Then Vitagraph made its first comedy in 1897, fifty-one years ago.  It was a little picture with a cast of three.  The total cost of production was $3.50 minus the cost of film, which at that time was seven and 7/8 cents per foot.  The next year, in 1898, we produced our first feature picture.  It was a reproduction of the Battle of Santiago Bay, or the destruction of Admiral Cervera's Spanish fleet. The total cost of production was $1.98.  This was inexpensive because we made the picture from cutouts of photographs which we tacked to little bits of wood and put in water with a piece of white cardboard in the rear for the sky.  The press was very good.  The press said that the picture was even better than the battle itself so it must have been good.

[Banters with presenter Frank Sinatra.] I'm very grateful to the Academy's Board of Directors for this happy tribute and to Frank for coming here especially to give it to me. And well, to all the fellows who worked so hard in finding those and assembling those film clips.You know, I may never look at this without remembering the quiet patience of the directors who were so kind to me, who were kind enough to put up with me more than once, some of them even three or four times. There was Howard Hawks, Hitchcock, the late Leo McCarey, George Stevens, George Cukor and Stanley Donen. And all the writers. There was Philip Barry, Dore Schary, Bob Sherwood, Ben Hecht, dear Clifford Odets, Sidney Sheldon, and more recently Stanley Shapiro and Peter Stone. Well, I trust they, and all the other directors, writers and producers and leading women, have all forgiven me what I didn't know.I realize it's conventional and usual to praise one's fellow workers on these occasions, but why not?! Ours is a collaborative medium, we all need each other. That's how we exist. And what better opportunity is there to publicly express one's appreciation and admiration and affection for all those who contribute so much to each of our welfare. You know, I've never been a joiner or a member of any particular social set, but I've been privileged to be a part of Hollywood's most glorious era. And yet tonight, thinking of all the empty screens that are waiting to be filled with marvelous images and idealogies, points of view, whatever, and considering all the students who are studying film techniques in the universities throughout the world and the astonishing young talents that are coming up in our midst, I think there's an even more glorious era right around the corner.So before I leave you, I want to thank you very much for signifying your approval with this. I shall cherish it until I die, because probably no greater honor can come to any man than the respect of his colleagues. Thank you.

Thank you very much. Thank you, Greg. This is truly an all-consuming thrill for me tonight. Over the years I've been part of the awards wearing many different hats Š—– performer, emcee, presenter, recipient Š—– but this is the top of the moment of my little walk-on in life, you might say. And I've been doing a little more thinking and contemplating these days than I did twenty-five years ago. That's because I'm what is known in the vernacular as a retired man now. You might have read about that in your neighborhood throw-aways. One of the things I've been thinking about is why you have to get famous to get an award for helping other people. I'm not being facetious about it; I've just been thinking about it. It's true, actually. If your name is John Doe and you work night and day doing things for your helpless neighbors, what you get for your effort is tired. So Mr. and Mrs. Doe and all of you who give of yourselves to those who carry too big a burden to make it on their own, I want you to reach out and take your share of this Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. Because if I have earned it so, too, have you. In fact, your way of earning it was harder than my way. Show business has made it easier for me to spread a dab of sunshine here and there. I mean, in show business they pay quite well. And being the quiet, conservative man that I am, I have invested a chunk at 3 percent and put the dividends to work in that noblest of all causes: charity toward your fellow man. It's the only investment in the world that pays 100 percent dividend.

(accepted on film),John Huston,"April 15, 1971; Dorothy Chandler Pavilion","Ladies and gentlemen, with this great honor may I say that it's a lot more fun to look forward. Looking backward over some thirty years in the movies is something that I like to do as seldom as possible, but I can't forget that I didn't spend those years alone. Every filmmaker knows how much was done for him and by how many. If I could call just half of all those who deserve it to stand beside me now in front of this camera, just to get 'em in one shot we'd need Cinerama. It'd be quite a crowd scene. As for the public, I hope that they will understand why this is the more precious just because it does not come to me from them, much less from the critics, but from movie people themselves, the ones who love movies most. We need the public; the public doesn't need us. That's the truth of it. We don't really fill a pressing popular need; we try to create it. And if we didn't love movies as much as we do, if we weren't a little crazy on the subject, there wouldn't be any movies at all. I treasure this award as an expression of this happy lunacy, and may I accept it, please, not so much for what I may have done as for what I hope to do.

Well, it certainly is thrilling for me and it's nice to get the Irving Thalberg Award handed to me from another director, and a good one, too.  I was a very dear, dear friend of Irving Thalberg's and it was a shame that a man like Irving Thalberg had to pass away at thirty-seven years old.  He was a genius.  He had great heart, great feeling, great imagination.  After a preview that you'd go to, Irving would sit up with you upstairs at Metro and he'd say, ""I know what's good about the picture, tell me what's wrong about the picture.""  And Irving never made a criticism about a movie unless he could improve it.  That's the kind of a man he was.  And this means so much to me that I can't tell you.  He was quite a guy.  I loved him. He was very close to me.  I wish we had more Irving Thalbergs around today, but they're around and they'll come out, believe me. I want to thank the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for giving me this beautiful award, voting it for me, believing in me, because they've done so much for the world. And tonight I think they've done more for the world than ever by showing what Hollywood does and running all of these beautiful acts and beautiful scenes on Telstar, of which I am a stockholder. We were going to run some films tonight but they're a little late and I'm a little late and I'm a little nervous. And I want to thank you all and I love you all. And this means so much to me.

And he said I'd probably win an acting award if I could do it.  Well, the truth is I'm not very prepared and I don't feel very dignified.  But I want to say just a couple of things about how a filmmaker like Woody evolves.  About seven years ago, David Picker brought us into United Artists with the simple words: Woody, do your thing.  And through the years we have gotten nothing but support, encouragement, help and love from Eric Pleskow, Arthur Krim, Gabe Sumner and Danny Rissner.  They've allowed Woody to mature into a fine filmmaker.  This is truly an exciting night for all of us.  I guess we all fantasize about something like this happening and now it's a reality.  I'm very pleased.  And thank you. I understand that Bob Hope had made a statement earlier today that Woody's nomination was gonna have some importance in bringing comedy forward in the Academy affairs.

They are the invisible handicapped and can't share this evening, so this is my way of acknowledging them. [End sign language.]I'm so proud and grateful. It's been almost eight years. This film, ""Coming Home,"" was born in Santa Monica where we live, in the cramped offices of the Indochina Peace Campaign, as a lot of us whose lives have been bound up with the war sat on the floor. And some of them were veterans. I thank, I thank all of them. One of them was my husband, Tom Hayden; one of them was Bruce Gilbert, who has become my partner and is the associate producer of ""Coming Home.""I want to thank Waldo Salt, the first _ how do you...? Heavy. The first industry heavy who stuck his neck out and believed in the project. In fact he believed so much in it that he worked for two years for nothing. And he lead us to Jerry Hellman, our producer, who fought for us. And I want to thank you, Jerry, very much. And I want to thank Haskell Wexler who photographed it so sensitively and Bob Jones who came through in the pinch. And I want to thank Hal Ashby; you're not here, Hal, but I want to thank you for your taste and for your courage, for your ability with the scissors.

Tonight, six years later, I have an Oscar, but for the people of whom I wrote the war still goes on.  I'm thinking of them tonight.  Thank you.

Bobby Muller and his fine wife, Bill Hager, T. Hager, Ron Kovic, Roger Steffens and his Mary, Tim Page, and so many others that I can't list; I hope that they will forgive me. Some of the people, who would prefer not to be named I believe, who worked in the veterans facilities here in the Bronx and who shared their experiences with us. To all of the men who fought in Vietnam: those who lost their lives, those who lost their innocence, and those who, working with defoliants, still don't know whether they've lost their lives.

I've been critical of the Academy, and for reason. I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to be able to work. I am greatly honored for being chosen by the producer, Stanley Jaffe, and the director, Bob Benton, and to have worked in a family with them, and with Meryl and with Justin, who if he loses again we'll have to give him a lifetime achievement award.

And to the crew and to the directors like Bob Fosse and Mike Nichols and John Schlesinger that I've worked with before. We are laughed at when we are up here, sometimes, for thanking. But when you work on a film you discover that there are people who are giving that artistic part of themself that goes beyond a paycheck, and they are never up here. And many of them are not members of the Academy, and we never hear of them. But this Oscar is a symbol, I think, and it is given for appreciation from those people whom we never see. They are part of our life.I refuse to believe that I beat Jack Lemmon, that I beat Al Pacino, that I beat Peter Sellers. I refuse to believe that Robert Duvall lost. We are a part of an artistic family. There are sixty thousand actors in this Academy _ pardon me _ in the Screen Actors Guild, and probably a hundred thousand in Equity. And most actors don't work, and a few of us are so lucky to have a chance to work with writing and to work with directing. Because when you're a broke actor you can't write; you can't paint; you have to practice accents while you're driving a taxi cab.

This is a great personal honor for me and it's particularly wonderful because it's associated with a film of which I feel so very proud.  ""Best Boy"" took three-and-a-half years to make but it was very much a labor of love.  And it tells the story of my fifty-two-year-old cousin Philly, who's mentally retarded, and his parents who are near eighty and about how he finally comes to separate from them as their lives end and his life has to go on.  The film has been seen mainly on the East Coast, and with documentaries it's not always easy to get people to come and see the film.  And if this award will help more people to come and see it then it will really be doing its job. I want to thank the Association for the Help of Retarded Children in New York City for their support of the film and for the wonderful work they did with Philly. I want to thank the entire crew, but in particular Tom McDonough, director of photography, who gave his sensitivity and intelligence and understanding and made the film much more than it would have otherwise been. I want to thank my cousins Frances and Norman, my aunt and uncle who are no longer alive, my aunt Pearl, my uncle Max.

And thank you, Mr. Hoffman, for your over-generous words and all that deep research work you did. It's five weeks ago that I had a telegram from the Academy telling me they were doing me this great honor, so I've had the time to recover from the shock. But I don't think I will ever have time to get over my amazement and my delight. There isn't time for me to thank everyone _ directors, writers, fellow actors _ who've made my life such a happy one, including those wonderful Hollywood stars who were my heroes when I was a youth.You know, when I was a drama student forty-seven years ago, I think, there used to be a formidable lady who came to take classes of what she called ""film technique.""

This belief, along with his sensitive direction, was the inspiration behind the project. I want to thank Bob for giving me the opportunity to produce this picture and I want to say he must come up here and share this with me. Bob, wherever you are, come on up.

My father didn't really believe that this was going to happen but he told me a while back that if it did he wanted his wife Shirlee to accept the award for him.  But Shirlee wanted to be with him tonight, as is her way, and so I'm here. And first and foremost I want to thank on behalf of my father the members of the Academy who voted to give him this award. I know that he's watching right now and I know that he's very, very honored and very happy and surprised. And I'll bet when he heard it just now, I bet he said, ""Hey, ain't I lucky?"" As though luck had anything to do with it. I know also that he has tremendous respect for the other actors that were nominated and has always felt a little strange about these things, these competitions, because it's like comparing apples and oranges, and he feels very proud to have been among such a wonderful group.And I know that he feels that he would never have won this if it hadn't been for Katharine Hepburn. And if ""On Golden Pond"" is one of the highlights of his life, one of the main reasons is because of her, having the chance to work with her and to become her friend. And I know that one of the other reasons that he feels the film was so special is because of the quality of the crew. Every one of them, many of whose talents have been recognized tonight in the nominations. And the wonderful cast: Dougie McKeon, Dabney Coleman, Bill Lanteau, me„he's a proud father. The man who pulled us all together, our producer Bruce Gilbert. He is, my father is so happy, he feels so fortunate to have been able to play the role of ""Norman Thayer,"" a character that he loves a lot and understands very well. And for this he'd like to thank the sensitive man who wrote the words, who's already been honored tonight, Ernest Thompson. And for the tremendous talent and guidance of our director Mark Rydell, he's very, very grateful. We all became like a family during the filming and we sort of stayed together since. People call him up and stay in touch and come to visit him, and so it's like we've stayed a family, and it's made my father very, very happy. And he wants to thank Marble Arch and Universal for their support of the movie ""On Golden Pond.""He also feels very lucky to have been able to spend a summer in such a beautiful part of our country, northern New Hampshire, and he wants to thank all the people there who were so friendly and welcoming to us. And he was very happy, and so was I and are we, to have had our two families together, the Haydens and the Fondas, on the beautiful shores of that lake so that we could get to know each other even more. He wishes my brother Peter were here tonight, but Peter is somewhere in the jungles of the Philippines in front of a camera right now, like a good Fonda. And I know that lastly, but really first, he is thanking Shirlee Fonda who has been his loving support for seventeen years, who he calls his Rock of Gibralter. I think she's his ""Ethel Thayer.""

And to his widow Dorothy, and Shanta and Rajni, I send my love and my very grateful thanks for the fact that their father gave me the idea of making this film. Members of the Academy, you have honored, you have seen fit to honor a number of people who have been connected with this film -- Jack and Ben and Billy, and many others. And particularly without Jack and Ben there would have been no movie. But I'm sure that they would agree that the person whom you really honor, as Ben suggested, was Mahatma Gandhi himself. He was an inspiration to millions and millions of people, and the extraordinary thing always seems to me, that he is currently still an inspiration. Your great folk hero Martin Luther King, Jr. was inspired by Mahatma Gandhi. Lech Walesa, that noble Polish patriot, came out of prison the other day and said that what he had been attempting to do in the past was not going to work. The only way in which we could find human dignity and peace was through the philosophies and teachings of Gandhi.Gandhi simply asked that we should examine the criteria by which we adjudge the manner of solving our problems. That surely in the 20th century we human beings searching for our human dignity could find other ways of ultimately solving our problems than blowing the other man's head off. He begged us to re-examine that criteria. He believed that if we would but agree, simplistic though it be, that we would not resort to violence in the ultimate. Then the route that we would take in solving our problems would be a quite different one to the one that we accept now in the acceptance of ultimate confrontation. He begged us to re-examine that criteria. I believe he had something to say to all of us everywhere in the world.And dear colleagues, in all truth -- because the films that were nominated with me all wished for the same thing, all their makers wanted to say the same thing -- and in all truth it is not me or even Ben or Jack or Billy that you truly honor. You honor Mahatma Gandhi and his plea to all of us to live in peace.",1982,Best Picture,1982.17,http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/results.aspx?AC=NEXT_RECORD&XC=/results.aspx&BU=http%3A%2F%2Faaspeechesdb.oscars.org%2F&TN=aatrans&SN=AUTO8997&SE=1457&RN=579&MR=0&TR=0&TX=1000&ES=0&CS=0&XP=&RF=WebReportList&EF=&DF=WebReportOscars&RL=0&EL=0&DL=0&NP=255&ID=&MF=oscarsmsg.ini&MQ=&TI=0&DT=&ST=0&IR=0&NR=314&NB=0&SV=0&SS=0&BG=&FG=&QS=&OEX=ISO-8859-1&OEH=utf-81982 (55th) Academy Awards,Short Film (Animated),Tango,"Zbigniew Rybczynski, Producer (with Polish translator Jolanta Czaderska-Hayek)","Matt Dillon, Kristy McNichol","April 11, 1983; Dorothy Chandler Pavilion","Distinguished members of the Academy, ladies and gentlemen, I made this short film so I will speak very short.

Studios, I was riding my bicycle like the wind with a load of call sheets in the basket.  And as I rounded the old First National cutting rooms I took my first meeting with a major studio executive.  I ran over Jack L. Warner on my bicycle.  I helped Mr. Warner to his feet, dusted his jacket off, and saw a three-day career flash before my eyes.  Mr. Warner said, when he had collected himself, ""Son, if you want to stay in this business, stay off the bicycle."" Well, I took his advice and here I am. Ladies and gentleman, members of the Academy, the Board of Governors, I should like to share this great honor with my associates David Pettijohn, Lou Edemann, Rick Franklin, Sam Crutcher, Norman Schwartz, John Roesch, Joan Rowe, Chuck Neely, and of course Ben Burtt.

Ah, no.  Like everybody who stands up here I've got a lot of debts; I just want to acknowledge three. One to Dickie, Sir Richard, for having the faith and courage to trust me with his dream, put up with me once it became mine too, and fulfilling both our dreams with such brilliance and honesty.  And to Ben, for a performance that went beyond dreams.  For me it's still emotional to watch Ben although I've seen it like fifty or sixty times.  I think it's so moving and so profound that it does an honor to our whole industry and justice even to the man that inspired the whole film. And then I would like to thank Gandhi himself. When I came to this material I despaired for it as drama and I didn't think it had much relevance in a world as cruel and as harsh as ours. But as I came to know the man I found that he knew everything we all know about our cruelty, our selfishness, our greed, our fears. But he also had a faith in the kind of stubborn resolution that we all have to be a little humane, to be a little understanding, to be a little, even, brotherly. And he lived his life in a way that showed that if we called upon that in ourselves and in our enemies, that there was hope for each of us and maybe for this planet. He gave me that. I tried in writing the screenplay to give it back in a way that he would have approved. I thank him.

In short, this industry has been exceedingly good to me.  It has provided me with the opportunity to realize many of my most deeply felt creative and professional aspirations.

It's really only for six minutes of fun, of love and joy, of working with, playing with, like children, the people that we all are on the screen.  I love every minute that God has given me to be an infinitesimal small part of this great business.  Sixty years, gosh, I... Tonight for my being here, and the responsibility really belongs to somebody that I'd love to put my arms around, like Judy Garland, and Lewis Stone, Fay Holden, Spencer Tracy, Wallace Beery.  Memories, I have a lot of memories, as we all do. When I was nineteen years old I was the number one star of the world, for two years. When I was forty, nobody wanted me. I couldn't get a job. And then a professor from the University of Tennessee got a show together with Terry Allen Kramer and Harry Rigby called ""Sugar Babies,"" and it resurrected my career. Last year God smiled upon me and I was given the Emmy for ""Bill,"" and I won the Peabody Award and the Golden Globe, and tonight you honor me beyond anything that a man should be given. You honor me with the greatest and the highest tribute we can receive in our business.My family all love you and they're all tingling inside because of this moment for me. I'd love to even kiss Louis B. Mayer. But it's, it's wonderful. The woman who put it all together was Ruth Webb, my agent, who picked up the pieces and put 'em back together. Mickey, Jr., Timmy, Teddy, Kelly, Kerry, Kyle, Kimmy Sue, Jimmy, Jonell, Chris and Mark, and my grandchildren, my grandchildren Shannon and Nika*. They're home tonight looking and saying, ""That's Granddaddy up there, and he's got the Oscar."" But the one that's responsible, outside of God, is my wife Jan, who kept saying to me for the last seven years, ""I know you can do it, Mick. Get up off the canvas. You can do it.""

I'm very excited, very happy, very moved, very everything tonight, to be up here, to be singled out from among all these very talented people.  I sometimes come to the Academy Awards and watch them year after year, and I get caught up in the spectacle of it, in the event, in the very complex type of entertainment and I guess, I know I forget, that what we're really here for is to single out who we think is the best for that given year.  And if that's what I am to be this year then I appreciate it.  I accept it with an honor and I'm very moved because of that. I think we set out to make a film, a very truthful film, a very good film. I think Bruce Beresford, Horton Foote, the Hobels, EMI, should all be commended for a very wonderful job that they did in putting this film together. I think it's a valid film, valid enough that we have gotten very much applause of a certain kind from certain members of the country western community, such as my friend Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings. And this is certainly a very high level of criticism coming from those people. And if I didn't have that on one hand, I would feel that this on the other hand was not complete.

I have wondered for twenty-six years what this would feel like.  Thank you so much for terminating the suspense.  Oh my, I am nervous. I'm not going to thank everybody I've ever met in my entire life -- although, with the way my mind has been going lately probably everybody I've ever met in my entire life and in the other life I might have had had something to do with this. You know, if ""Terms of Endearment"" had happened to me five years ago, I think I would have called it a thrilling, commercial, artistic accident. But I don't believe that anymore. I don't believe there's any such thing as accident. I think that we all manifest what we want and what we need. I don't think there's any difference really between what you feel you have to do in your heart and success. They're inseparable.Jim Brooks deeply wanted to make a film about the defects and imperfections and foibles of people in a humorous and loving way. And he had such passion. It was unbelievable to watch. He's being very modest with himself tonight. It was unbelievable. His sense of truth was so accurate that he overwhelmed his own insecurities, and Paramount's. I guess we all did the same thing. I have wanted to work with the comic chemistry of Jack Nicholson since his chicken salad sandwich scene in ""Easy Pieces."" And to have him in bed was such middle-aged joy. I wanted to work with the turbulent brilliance of Debra Winger. She literally inhabited the character so thoroughly that I thought for four months I had two daughters.But in the end just let me say one thing. Films and life are like clay waiting for us to mold it. And when you trust your own insides, and that becomes achievement, it's a kind of a principle that seems to me is at work with everyone. God bless that principle. God bless that potential that we all have for making anything possible if we think we deserve it. I deserve this.

This is truly a beautiful, wonderful moment for each one of us.  We acknowledge the tremendous, magnificent effort that went into the making of this film.  We are privileged to have been a part of it and the experience will long live in our hearts.  We must thank our marvelous, beautiful, we-love-you-Phil Kaufman director, for his leadership and dedication and for the vision that he gave to us.  We thank The Ladd Company, Alan Ladd, Jr., especially Gareth Wigan for his gentlemanly guidance, concern, care, all through the project.  And before I give the microphone to my colleagues, I would like to say that we do thank our assistant editors and apprentice editors for their marvelous, dedicated support all through the project, who kept their sense of humor and carried us through to the end. ""The Right Stuff"" required a monumental effort on the part of a lot of people, not all of whom we can thank tonight, but I'd like to just add to those already mentioned our producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler, who were the first to see the possibilities for a terrific movie in Tom Wolfe's book. And again, our director Phil Kaufman, who transformed that book into a fantastic script and then into a fantastic movie from which we were able to work with terrific footage and whose vision carried us throughout the editing. For myself, I'd like to just thank my husband for his unwavering support during a difficult year and a half, and my colleagues Francis Coppola, Walter Murch and Bill Reynolds, without whose support and inspiration I wouldn't be here tonight. Thank you.If I can just thank my wife Janet, my daughter Zoe, my good friend Dede Allen, and Phil and Rose.

And I'm deeply appreciative to the Motion Picture Academy and its Board of Governors for choosing me to join such illustrious company as Frank Sinatra and the other past winners of the Jean Hersholt Award.  Each of them has been a beacon to the rest of us in the motion picture industry and we have all gained in stature through their generosity, their caring, and their concern. As I stand here tonight, I can't help but think that I lived and was brought up just a couple of blocks from here. I sold newspapers down the street on the corner of First and Broadway. I also think of all the people in our profession who I have learned from and who have helped me along the way. There was Doug Fairbanks, Sr. who gave me my first job in the motion pictures. And I was nine years old and I played a choirboy in a picture called ""Rosita."" Doug Fairbanks was a man who cared about kids and I liked him for that. I learned even more about caring and loving children from Joe E. Brown who was like a second father to me.I owe a lot to my dear friend Leo Jaffe who brought me into the Columbia Pictures and who showed me that even when running a big company there was always enough time to help someone who needed help. And for my years in England I shall always remember the shining example from Lord Louis Mountbatten. I saw how much he loved children. I saw it first in India, in China, and during World War II. I saw it afterwards in the East End of London. And I learned what it meant to be gracious and to be compassionate from a beautiful actress, a beautiful star, and my leading lady for forty-four years, Binnie Barnes.I would like to share this award with each of these people who I've spoken about who meant so much to me with all of you in the entertainment industry, especially the men and women of the Variety Clubs International, the greatest children's charity in the world.

Well, the nicest thing that ever happened to me, Mr. Roach, was when you hired me fifty-two years ago. But there was something that I never did ask you. What was Hollywood really like out here in 1912?Oh, 1912. The first day that I worked in motion pictures I received a dollar a day, car fare and lunch. The car fare was two tokens, from in front of the post office downtown to Hollywood, one to take you there and one to bring you back to Los Angeles. The lunch was two sandwiches and a banana. And that is a little start of the 1912 business.But I understand the thing has grown a little more expensive today and people are trying a little harder to save money in making pictures. And they're doing a lot of things to try to curtail the expense. And the only thing I can add to that is my experience in those days as far as making pictures were concerned.For example, when a comedian for Mack Sennett did a ""Brodie"" or fell on his rear, he fell on a cake of soap or a pile of oil or something like that, or something else, but anyway -- I got all screwed up to start with. I meant to say pratfall to start with. But anyway, the Hal Roach Studios did it a different way. You remember I said two sandwiches and a banana? Well, the property man after lunch would pick up all the banana skins and put 'em away for safekeeping. Then anytime that a Hal Roach comedian did a pratfall he slipped on the banana peel. And they slipped many times, and every time they did we used another thing. But the thing that was great about it was the fact that the bananas didn't cost me anything.Just one thing in conclusion and that is this, that all these talented people that have been winning Oscars here tonight, they all make their money in an old-fashioned way. They earn it!",1983,Honorary Award,1983.25,http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/results.aspx?AC=NEXT_RECORD&XC=/results.aspx&BU=http%3A%2F%2Faaspeechesdb.oscars.org%2F&TN=aatrans&SN=AUTO8997&SE=1457&RN=613&MR=0&TR=0&TX=1000&ES=0&CS=0&XP=&RF=WebReportList&EF=&DF=WebReportOscars&RL=0&EL=0&DL=0&NP=255&ID=&MF=oscarsmsg.ini&MQ=&TI=0&DT=&ST=0&IR=0&NR=314&NB=0&SV=0&SS=0&BG=&FG=&QS=&OEX=ISO-8859-1&OEH=utf-81984 (57th) Academy Awards,Actor in a Leading Role,Amadeus,F.

Thalberg Memorial Award,No title.,Steven Spielberg,Richard Dreyfuss,"March 30, 1987; Dorothy Chandler Pavilion","I'm resisting like crazy to use Sally Field's line from two years ago. Thank you very much. Following in the footsteps of some of my heroes, Cecil B. De Mille and George Stevens, Alfred Hitchcock, William Wyler, Ingmar Bergman and Robert Wise, this award is truly a great honor for me. The Thalberg Award was first given fifty years ago in 1937, which was the year of ""In Old Chicago,"" ""Captains Courageous,"" ""Dead End,"" ""The Life of Emile Zola,"" ""Lost Horizon,"" ""Stage Door"" and ""A Star Is Born""„all having been nominated for Best Picture that year. I'm told Irving Thalberg worshipped writers. And that's where it all begins. That we are first and foremost storytellers, and without, as he called it, ""the photoplay,"" everybody is simply improvising. He also knew that a script is more than just a blueprint. That the whole idea of movie magic is that interweave of powerful image and dialogue and performance and music that can never be separated, and when it's working right, can never be duplicated or ever forgotten.I've grown up„most of my life has been spent in the dark watching movies. Movies have been the literature of my life. The literature of Irving Thalberg's generation was books and plays. They read the great words of great minds. And I think in our romance with technology and our excitement at exploring all the possibilities of film and video, I think we've partially lost something that we now have to reclaim. I think it's time to renew our romance with the word. I'm as culpable as anyone in having exalted the image of the word at the expense of...exalting the image at the expense of the word. But only a generation of readers will spawn a generation of writers.The five films nominated for Best Picture this year are as much the writer's film as the director's. And it's good news that each of these films has found its audience. Because this audience, who we all work for, deserves everything we have to give them. They deserve that fifth draft, that tenth take, that one extra cut and those several dollars over budget. And Irving Thalberg knew that. He would have been proud to have been associated with any of these films, as I am proud to have my name on this award in his honor. Because it reminds me of really how much growth as an artist I have ahead of me in order to be worthy of standing in the company of those who have received this before me. So my deepest thanks to the Board of Governors of the Academy and the audience out there in the dark. Thank you very much.",1986,Honorary Award,1986.26,http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/results.aspx?AC=NEXT_RECORD&XC=/results.aspx&BU=http%3A%2F%2Faaspeechesdb.oscars.org%2F&TN=aatrans&SN=AUTO8997&SE=1457&RN=692&MR=0&TR=0&TX=1000&ES=0&CS=0&XP=&RF=WebReportList&EF=&DF=WebReportOscars&RL=0&EL=0&DL=0&NP=255&ID=&MF=oscarsmsg.ini&MQ=&TI=0&DT=&ST=0&IR=0&NR=314&NB=0&SV=0&SS=0&BG=&FG=&QS=&OEX=ISO-8859-1&OEH=utf-81987 (60th) Academy Awards,Actor in a Leading Role,Wall Street,Michael Douglas,Marlee Matlin (with sign language interpreter Jack Jason),"April 11, 1988; Shrine Civic Auditorium","Thank you.

Thalberg Memorial Award,No title.,Billy Wilder,Jack Lemmon,"April 11, 1988; Shrine Civic Auditorium","Thank you very much.  I understand that this is the most prestigious award you can get, with the possible exception of the Nobel Prize, of course.  I would like you to take this [removes trophy from the podium and hands it to Jack Lemmon] because I have a feeling this is gonna break. I would especially like to thank„after having thanked the governors of the Academy and the members, and all the millions of fans I have all over the world, in the civilized parts of the world„I would very much like to thank one specific gentleman without whose help I would not be standing here tonight. I have forgotten his name but I have never forgotten his compassion. He was the American consul in Mexicali, Mexico.Now, imagine it's 1934. It's a year after the Hitler putsch. We are all in exile: Zurich, London, Paris. Then I get lucky. I sell a story to Hollywood and I get the visitor's visa for six months. Then I come here and start working, but six months go by very, very fast. Well, I don't want to leave. I would like to stay in America. So, I am being told that I need an immigration visa, for which reason you„I mean, you have to leave the country, get the immigration visa and then come back in order to re-enter with the proper papers. So I go to Mexicali which is the closest American consulate right across the border from California. And as they showed me into the office of the consul I was drenched in sweat. It was not the heat. It was just the panic, the fear. I knew that I needed a whole bunch of documents: affidavits, official proof of former residence, sworn testaments that I had never been a criminal or an anarchist. I had nothing, zilch. Just my passport and my birth certificate and some letters from a few American friends vouching that I was harmless. It looked hopeless. The consul„he looked a little bit like Will Rogers„examined my meager documentation. ""Is that all you have?"" he asked. And I said, ""Yes."" I have to explain that, you know, I had to get out of Berlin on very short notice, like twenty minutes. A neighbor had tipped me off that two men in uniform had been looking for me. I had just enough time to throw in a few things in the suitcase and get on a night train to Paris. The consul just stared at me and said, ""I mean, how do you expect me to, with just those papers?"" And I told him, I tried to get them from Nazi Germany but they just would not respond. Of course I could get them if I went back to Germany, then they would put me naturally on the train and ship me off to Dachau. So, he just kept staring and staring at me and I was not sure whether I was getting through to him. I have heard of whole families who have spent years there waiting for the visa and other guys who never got in. And believe me, I wanted to get back to America. It looked bad.So we just sat there and stared at each other, the consul and I, in total silence. Finally he asked me, ""What do you do? I mean professionally?"" And I said, ""I write movies."" And he said, ""That so?"" He got up and started pacing, kind of behind me, but I felt that he was measuring me. Then he came back to the desk, picked up my passport, opened it, and took a rubber stamp and went [thumps twice on the podium], handed me back the passport and he said, ""Write some good ones.""That was fifty-four years ago. I've tried ever since. I certainly did not want to disappoint that dear man in Mexicali. And you know, as I look back, you know, I've lived a charmed life. I never expected something like this, like the Thalberg Award. You are without any doubt the most generous people in the world. And I hope you're watching, I. A. L., because part of this is yours. So get well, will you?

I am very proud of this honor and obviously my thanks go to many people.  The artists who have been part of our films.  David, my partner and dear friend for many years.  My wife and partner, Lili, who has brought so much inspiration into my life.  And to my father, who taught me so much and who gave me such an early opportunity. Thank you very much. Thank you, Dick, and thank you, Michael. What can I add to this extraordinary evening? ""Thank you"" seems too mild a response to the Academy's governors for this kind of honor. Frankly, I'm simply overwhelmed. Simply, I'm frankly overwhelmed!And yet I must add that I am also grateful to both Zanucks, Darryl and Dick. Darryl brought me to Hollywood, and I had the good fortune and longevity to continue the Zanuck connection through the many years Dick and I shared as partners and close friends. We intend to continue to justify the accolade the Academy's Governors have bestowed on us and hope to be worthy of the distinguished company in which they have placed us.

And we made some movies for them. And I'll never forget when Mike Medavoy said, ""I think there's a book you might be interested in. I'll send it over."" And it's obvious, I know everybody feels the extraordinary irony of what's happened, this terrible thing that's happened to Orion at a moment of re-emergence that included ""Silence of the Lambs"" and many other things.Anyway, two other quick things. I'm sorry, this is almost„one, just about directing. I wanted very much to salute John Singleton and Matty Rich and Jodie Foster and Ernest Dickerson and a bunch of new people in the last year that have come on with very exciting, wonderful visions and really breathed tremendously important new life into our whole cinematic landscape.

That's something everyone facing AIDS not only needs, but deserves. There's an inscription at Howard's grave in Baltimore. It reads, ""O, that he had one more song to sing.""

Now, recently a young girl came up to me. I was at a function for the South Bronx, which is where I'm from. And she said that I had encouraged her, and that's not necessarily by my work but just by the fact that we came from the same place.

And to the millions of Americans who may or may not get to see this film now that public TV has also refused a broadcast.In closing, I'd just like to say we have a tremendous amount of potential in the world and those of us here have a tremendous amount of potential to impact the world.

I call upon you to draw from the depths of your being to prove that we are a human race. To prove that our love outweighs our need to hate. That our compassion is more compelling than our need to blame. That our sensitivity to those in need is stronger than our greed. That our ability to reason overcomes our fear.

I could not be standing here without that undying love that was just sung about by, not Bruce [Springsteen], but Neil Young.  And I have that in a lover that is so close to fine, we should all be able to experience such heaven right here on earth.  I know also that, I should not be doing this, I should not be here, but I am because of the union of such filmmakers as Ed Saxon, Ron Nyswaner, Kristi Zea, Tak Fujimoto, Jonathan Demme -- who seems to have these [referring to the Oscar] attached to his limbs for every actor that works with him of late.  And a cast that includes Antonio Banderas, who, second to my lover, is the only person I would trade for.  And a cast that includes many other people, but the actor who really put his film image at risk, and shone because of his integrity, Mr. Denzel Washington, who I really must share this with. I would not be standing here if it weren't for two very important men in my life, so... two that I haven't spoken with in awhile, but I had the pleasure of just the other evening. Mr. Rawley Farnsworth, who was my high school drama teacher, who taught me to act well the part, there all the glory lies. And one of my classmates under Mr. Farnsworth, Mr. John Gilkerson. I mention their names because they are two of the finest gay Americans, two wonderful men that I had the good fortune to be associated with, to fall under their inspiration at such a young age. I wish my babies could have the same sort of teacher, the same sort of friends.And there lies my dilemma here tonight. I know that my work in this case is magnified by the fact that the streets of heaven are too crowded with angels. We know their names. They number a thousand for each one of the red ribbons that we wear here tonight. They finally rest in the warm embrace of the gracious creator of us all. A healing embrace that cools their fevers, that clears their skin, and allows their eyes to see the simple, self-evident, common sense truth that is made manifest by the benevolent creator of us all and was written down on paper by wise men, tolerant men, in the city of Philadelphia two hundred years ago.

I didn't.  And so then they got me a piano.  So for the next ten years they let me have piano lessons.

And it's just so wonderful to be acknowledged with a great group of movies.  Nine years ago I met a very special man who has since taken me on an amazing journey.  There were many people who gave him gifts along the way.  Eric Roth, you gave ""Forrest"" a soul.  Tom Hanks, you gave ""Forrest"" a heart.  And Bob Zemeckis, you gave ""Forrest"" a vision.  Steve Tisch and Steve Starkey, you were great co-parents.  ""Forrest"" was a labor of love to many people:  our wonderful cast and crew, Sherry, Jon, Michelle, John, Barry, Arthur, all the people at Paramount, Winston, Craig, Rand.  To my parents, grandparents, family, thank you for your support.  To my husband Mark Canton, for your love and always saying go make this dream a reality.  My parents always said dreams can come true, and to my own children, Dorothy, Henry and James, if you doubt it, please remember tonight because I always will.  Thank you. All over the political map people have been calling ""Forrest"" their own. But ""Forrest Gump"" isn't about politics or conservative values. It's about humanity. It's about respect, tolerance and unconditional love. And tonight we should all feel proud that we are in a business where we entertain, we educate, and we empower.

Now I don't know if it was destiny or if it was chance that brought together the talented cast and extraordinary crew of ""Forrest Gump,"" but maybe as ""Forrest"" said: ""Maybe it was both, maybe both were happening at the same time."" But in any case, as I look back I can't imagine making this film without any one of them or without the commitment of Sherry Lansing and Paramount Studios. But most of all, the picture could not have been made without the gentle spirit of Tom Hanks and the guidance and inspiration of the guy we fondly call Bob Z, the truly visionary director Bob Zemeckis.

They were my boyhood idols as far as filmmakers. And a lot of them were directors, producers -- and just straight producers -- and they were experts. These people had a great influence and they were experts in a business that has very few experts, really. In fact, if anybody asked me about making films I would say that it's probably a little expertise and a lot of luck. Now, how I fit into that equation?

I want to thank Scott Hicks and all of the ""Shine"" team for giving me the chance to have a glimpse of the bird of paradise. Scott, thank you. My darling wife Jane, I wouldn't be standing here without you, and to Merle and John, my mum and stepdad in Queensland. And to the unstoppable David Helfgott. The front of my script said that this story was inspired by the events of your life. You truly are an inspiration. And to those people who say it's a circus, then with your celebration of life you show me that the circus is a place of daring and risk-taking and working without a safety net and giving us your personal poetry.

Twenty-five years ago we worked together and he hasn't forgiven me since for yelling at him.  But, that's show business. I'd like to talk to [you] for a minute about passion. Don't move around in your chairs, or change the station on your TV set, as the following words will be innocent. Darryl Zanuck, Hal Wallis, David Selznick, Walt Disney and Samuel Goldwyn are among the giants who were the early recipients of this award. All are recognized as producers who brought passion to their films. And they were really bound together by their love of moviemaking. Passion is [the] immeasurable, indescribable factor that separates movie from movie. Passion moves freely across borders, speaks every language and flourishes in every culture. The movement of passion is the most gratifying satisfaction in any moviemaker's life. This happens when you see and hear people all over the world share their laughter, their crying and their sudden gasps at identical screen moments. Samuel Hoffenstein, a poet and screenwriter, poetically wrote, ""The Holy Grail is not in the finding, it is in the journey."" The Irving Thalberg Award memorializes a giant among giants who brought us a sense of film history. This belongs to the many with whom I have shared dreams and journeys. My cup is full.

Now I don't want it to stop.  I can't act and I can't compose and I can't do visual effects, so I guess that's why I'm producing.  But I have a lot of people that I have to thank on behalf of both Jim and myself.  I want to thank all the nominees here this evening, and all the people that again they've already thanked.  Our incredible cast, we would not be here without you.  My wife Julie, my sons Jamie and Jody.  Rae Sanchini, who is absolutely one of the best people in this industry.

We would not be here without an incredible screenwriter who wrote a great script, Jim Cameron. I think Jon saw ""Shine"" too many times. He thanked everybody and did everything I was going to say. And my eyes are still sort of doing pinwheels from the last one, so I just want to say a couple of things. We're here tonight to celebrate the magic of movies. And I'm grateful every day to get to be a part of that magic and a practitioner in it, and I love it. And tonight has been such a great celebration for us. And it seems to somehow express this strange wave that's happened with ""Titanic,"" where people all over the world have opened their hearts to this movie. And that's so gratifying to all of us that worked on it and we'll be forever grateful to them, the audience, and I know a lot of you are watching at home.In the midst of all this euphoria, it's kind of hard for us to remember that this euphoria and the success is for a film that's based on a real event that happened, where real people died, that shocked the world in 1912. So I'd just like everybody to go with me just for a second on something here. I'd like to do a few seconds of silence in remembrance of the 1,500 men, women and children who died when the great ship died. The message of ""Titanic"" of course is, that if the great ship can sink, the unthinkable can happen, the future is unknowable, the only thing that we truly own is today. Life is precious. So during these few seconds I'd like you to also listen to the beating of your own heart which is the most precious thing in the world. Join me please in a few seconds of silence for ""Titanic"" . . . . Thank you very much. That's about as much as I'm sure Gil Cates can stand.

Then you cast Cary Grant, or Audrey Hepburn, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Sophia Loren, Richard Burton, Rex Harrison, Gregory Peck, Elizabeth Taylor, Burt Reynolds, Gene Hackman or Frank Sinatra -- like that.

And Miramax, who had the courage to finish it.Our fantastic crew. And who else are we thanking?I'd like to thank Mark Cooper, Cleone Clarke, and my partner in all things, Liz Barron. Thank you.The other guy that we really need to thank, though, is Harvey Weinstein, who had the guts, the courage, the commitment to make this picture and get it done. Here he is. Say a few words...This was an ensemble film, and it took an ensemble team to make it. I want to thank at Disney: Michael Eisner and Joe Roth, who've given me great latitude and great support. At Universal: Edgar Bronfman, Ron Meyer, Stacey, Nadia Bronson, Chris McGurk. At Miramax: My brilliant Meryl Poster, my head of production who rocks the universe and makes us look good. Oh man, Julie Goldstein, who is the most persevering, brilliant executive producer. To Bob Osher, to Mark Gill and Marcy Granata, who are the one and two most dynamite marketing team.And your brother Bob...I'm getting there, okay. I don't know, we made this movie -- this is a movie about life and art. And art and life combining is called magic. For me, this was a great experience, a passion, for five years. And nobody inspires me more than my brother Bob, who is my partner and best friend every day. My loving wife Eve; my two rotten kids, Lily and Emma; my beautiful nieces, Sarah and Nicole; and my mom Miriam. The Miriam of Miramax [music begins to play] who makes Jewish mothers look good.

Forty years of filmmaking and they did it in three minutes!  Well, Irving, you're one heavy dude.  I'll tell you that... You want to hold him? He's about twenty pounds! There's a lot of people to thank, of course, but Irving once said that brevity is a great virtue. So, I accept this great honor tonight in the names of all those people who have contributed to my work, my life's work. Forty years ago, I sat at William Wyler's feet and tried to learn how to make movies. And Willy Wyler was a god to me, and he won this award.

I would like to thank my immediate loved ones, my family, every actor, writer, editor, cinematographer, production designer, costume designer, sound man and editor I've ever worked with. All those crews in Europe and Canada and the United States.And my one real regret about winning this prize is that, you know, it's not like the Nobel or the Pulitzer. I mean, the Thalberg Award comes with no money attached. If it did, if it did, I would share it with the Canadian Film Centre and the AFI where the next generation of filmmakers are preparing to entertain the world in the new millennium. And my parting thought to all those young filmmakers is this: Just find some good stories. Never mind the gross, the top ten, bottom ten, what's the rating, what's the demographic. You know something, the biggest grossing picture is not necessarily the best picture, I want to tell you something. So just tell stories that move us to laughter and tears, and perhaps reveal a little truth about ourselves.

Thalberg Memorial Award,No title.,Warren Beatty,Jack Nicholson,"March 26, 2000; Shrine Auditorium & Expo Center","Thank you.  You know, although some might say it's a little soon to be giving this thing to a guy in his early forties...  To have known that I was going to get it, particularly this year with all the... It's been very helpful around the house.  I must say that if you had your choice and you could get the Thalberg Award or the White House, I think I'd stick with this.  I don't want to talk politics here and I don't want to suggest some direction that the movies should go into, but I think I would like to, if I may, pay tribute to the memory of my mother Kathlyn, my father Ira, and to the people who nurtured me as a child in Virginia with my sister Shirley, and beginning with Stella Adler and Elia Kazan, and to all the people who worked with me and taught me. I came to Hollywood when I was in my early twenties. Many of the previous winners of this award actually taught me. You know, Sam Goldwyn was in his eighties, God bless him, and he treated me like a grown-up. Now it's very interesting, I think that most of the people who are teaching me now, they all seem to be in their early twenties and I do whatever I can to keep them -- I try to get them to stop treating me like a grown-up. But I thank them, I thank them.I thank my profession for giving me freedom and access. The freedom to live a much fuller life apart from the movies, and the access to get out and get to know the world and then come back and go back to making movies. Please forgive me for not making more of them. I'll try to do better. Thank you so much for encouraging my voice in public affairs. Please forgive me if I've used it stridently, or in fact not often enough. I'll try to do better. To my fellow actors, I would like to say thank you. Thank you for making me look good. I'm first, last, and always an actor, my pride in that is unbounded. Please forgive me for being a producer. I'll try to do better.[To Jack Nicholson on stage:] You can't hear me? Let me tell you this... alright.Okay, now, to those of you who may have heard rumor here or there of my life in Hollywood as a single man. The poet wrote, ""Only solitary men know the true joy of friendship. Others have their family, but to a solitary man his friends are everything."" So I want to thank you, my friends, for leading me through those days, and finally, in fact, leading me to Annette. Please forgive me for making her unavailable to your movies four times -- that's four times. I would like to say I'll try to do better, but you and I know that I won't. So, let's just say that I'll try to do less. Yes, I'll try to do less. She is my treasure. She has given me what I value most, her love. And she's given me Kathlyn and Ben and Isabel and at the moment, this much anticipated and very loved unnamed being, who could actually join us any minute right here in the second row if I don't wrap this up.So, I cannot imagine a public circumstance in which so many affirmations of work and life that could converge at one time. Let me put it another way -- as a screenwriter, I'd never sit still for it. You know, you can't have the husband up here getting this thing and the wife down there maybe getting that thing, and she's having a baby at the same time. It doesn't work, you have to throw it out, you have to pick one, they'll never believe it. So, I would say to you, don't worry, I don't ever expect another evening like this to be so full. But there are some things that really aren't going to change. They don't have to change, and please listen to me on this, Kathlyn and Ben and Isabel, I know you're not in bed. The things that don't have to change for us are our reliability of friendship, the sanctity of our family, and the dignity of our work. Thank you very much from way down here.",1999,Honorary Award,1999.25,http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/results.aspx?AC=NEXT_RECORD&XC=/results.aspx&BU=http%3A%2F%2Faaspeechesdb.oscars.org%2F&TN=aatrans&SN=AUTO8997&SE=1457&RN=1024&MR=0&TR=0&TX=1000&ES=0&CS=0&XP=&RF=WebReportList&EF=&DF=WebReportOscars&RL=0&EL=0&DL=0&NP=255&ID=&MF=oscarsmsg.ini&MQ=&TI=0&DT=&ST=0&IR=0&NR=314&NB=0&SV=0&SS=0&BG=&FG=&QS=&OEX=ISO-8859-1&OEH=utf-82000 (73rd) Academy Awards,Actor in a Leading Role,Gladiator,Russell Crowe,Hilary Swank,"March 25, 2001; Shrine Auditorium & Expo Center","Whew!

I'm still recovering from that. I got an opportunity to go to the most beautiful country on earth, in my opinion, work with a genuine fellowship of people and torture a lot of actors. I can't thank the Academy enough for this. It's, it's delirium.

Thank you, Papa.  It feels humbling to receive a humanitarian award for doing what my parents brought me up to do.  I had an unbelievably caring mother and father who lived their lives with the moral values of love and compassion, of respect and responsibility, of human dignity and standing up for what's right.  Even though they had a hard time earning a living they helped the poor and the hungry and they also helped others who needed the support of a friend or someone to stand up for their rights.  They felt all other people as individual human beings and judged them by their actions, not by their color or their race or their religion. I wish I could say that I'm as strong as they were in all those areas, but I'm so grateful to them for instilling these values in my loving sisters and me. And I'm so grateful to my loving wife and our wonderful children. My wife's so supportive. And Henryk and Erica just can't be better.

Back then, no route had been established for where I was hoping to go, no pathway left in evidence for me to trace, no custom for me to follow. Yet, here I am this evening at the end of a journey that in 1949 would have been considered almost impossible and in fact might never have been set in motion were there not an untold number of courageous, unselfish choices made by a handful of visionary American filmmakers, directors, writers and producers; each with a strong sense of citizenship responsibility to the times in which they lived; each unafraid to permit their art to reflect their views and values, ethical and moral, and moreover, acknowledge them as their own. They knew the odds that stood against them and their efforts were overwhelming and likely could have proven too high to overcome. Still those filmmakers persevered, speaking through their art to the best in all of us. And I've benefited from their effort. The industry benefited from their effort. America benefited from their effort. And in ways large and small the world has also benefited from their effort.Therefore, with respect, I share this great honor with the late Joe Mankiewicz, the late Richard Brooks, the late Ralph Nelson, the late Darryl Zanuck, the late Stanley Kramer, the Mirisch brothers, especially Walter whose friendship lies at the very heart of this moment, Guy Green, Norman Jewison, and all others who have had a hand in altering the odds for me and for others. Without them this most memorable moment would not have come to pass and the many excellent young actors who have followed in admirable fashion might not have come as they have to enrich the tradition of American filmmaking as they have. I accept this award in memory of all the African-American actors and actresses who went before me in the difficult years, on whose shoulders I was privileged to stand to see where I might go.My love and my thanks to my wonderful, wonderful wife, my children, my grandchildren, my agent and friend Martin Baum. And finally, to those audience members around the world who have placed their trust in my judgment as an actor and filmmaker, I thank each of you for your support through the years.

[To presenter Barbra Streisand:] I guess this is a sequel, huh, Babs? Well, Barbra's right, I am shy. It's a funny kind of business to be shy in, but [I] certainly feel that way tonight. But I think there certainly is a word of appreciation in order for being honored in such a way. You know, much of what happens here tonight is probably going to be forgotten in a week or so. But what's not going to be forgotten is what it means to those of us who are receiving awards or being honored tonight, and to those close to us. For those people, it can be the moment of a lifetime. So in my appreciation, I'd like to say what it means for me.I've spent most of my life just focused on the road ahead, not looking back. But now tonight, I'm seeing in the rear view mirror that there is something I've not thought about much, called history. And what moves me tonight is that I'm being joined by colleagues and peers to reflect on that history. There really are only two areas. One is my personal work, which is the most important to me. And the other is trying to put something back into an industry that's been good to me. And of course Sundance is a manifestation of that. And the result, well, a grand, grand collaboration of artists and colleagues who have joined to support and help give a voice to new artists. To those people who have supported us along the way, who have believed and participated, tonight I would really like to thank you deeply.We have a great industry and we all know that. We're here because we know it, we love it. It's a solid and healthy industry. But even though it is, I really believe it's going to be important in the years to come to make sure that we embrace the risks as well as the sure things, to make sure the freedom of artistic expression is nurtured and kept alive, because I believe that in keeping diversity alive it will help keep our industry alive. As we can see of late the world around us is in a sea change. It's just simply not the same world anymore. As we all struggle to find our way with it, to get a grip, to make sense out of the chaos and the destruction and the tragedy, one word that emerges is the word ""freedom""...its importance, its rarity and how fortunate we are to have it. To be able to be part of a freedom of expression that allows us as artists to tell our stories in our own way about the human condition, the complexities of life, the world around us, is a gift, and not one to be taken lightly. And I think the glory of art is that it can not only survive change, it can lead it. As an artist I just can't think of a better life than the one that I've been blessed with. It's just a great ride with many wonderful relationships and experiences along the way, and it's a ride I hope to continue.So tonight, I want to acknowledge my family, my love for them, my lady, the Academy and all of you for giving me this honor.

And they've been just... real strength. They've given me a great deal of strength.What can I say? This film would not be possible without the blueprint provided by Wladyslaw Szpilman. And this is a tribute to his survival. I'd like to thank Roman Polanski for the role of a lifetime. And for those of you who have seen the film and sat through the credits, you know there are just too many people to thank individually. I would not be here without all their efforts. And I thank them. And everyone worked extremely hard to make this film. And I have to thank Focus Features for getting us out there. To my longtime friend, manager, agent, consigliere, Joanne Colonna. Everybody at The Firm, PMK/HBH. And you know...[music plays]. Wait one second. One second, please, one second. Cut it out, cut it out. I get one shot at this. I'm sorry. I didn't say more than five names I don't think, but...This is, you know, it fills me with great joy, but I am also filled with a lot of sadness tonight because I'm accepting an award at such a strange time. And, you know, my experiences in making this film made me very aware of the sadness and the dehumanization of people at times of war, and the repercussions of war. And whomever you believe in, if it's God or Allah, may He watch over you. And let's pray for a peaceful and swift resolution. Thank you. And I have a friend from Queens who's a soldier in Kuwait right now, Tommy Zarabinski. And I hope you and your boys make it back real soon. God bless you, guys. I love you.

Couldn't have made the movie without them either.  My long suffering editors:  Charlie Silver, Brad Fuller, and Karen Schmeer and Doug Abel.  Thank you also very, very much. And believe it or not, Robert McNamara, with whom, if he hadn't done it there would have been no film.  Forty years ago this country went down a rabbit hole in Vietnam and millions died.  I fear we're going down a rabbit hole once again.  And if people can stop and think and reflect on some of the ideas and issues in this movie, perhaps I've done some damn good here!

I'm so honored, touched and relieved that the Academy and the members of the Academy that have supported us have seen past the trolls and the wizards and the hobbits and are recognizing fantasy this year.  Fantasy is an F-word that hopefully the five second delay won't do anything with.

A special thanks to Peter Nelson and Ken Kamins, who were with me right from the days of ""Bad Taste"" and ""Meet the Feebles,"" which were wisely overlooked by the Academy at that time.  And I especially want to pay tribute to our wonderful producer Barrie Osborne.  And I'd please like him to say a few words. It's a great honor to be here. I started out in the business thirty-five years ago getting people coffee. And I wonder if the fact that I dated Billy Crystal's cousin so many years ago has anything to do with this. But it is really a great pleasure to be in such great company--uh-oh, I'm in trouble now--to be nominated with these four other great films, and after these many years to receive this award is really a thrill for all of us and we all thank the Academy. It's really a tribute to the talents of all the people, both in front of the camera and behind the camera, that we win this award. I want to thank in particular my partner Carol, my beautiful daughter Danielle, and my eighty-seven-year-old dad who's out there in the back somewhere here to celebrate this with us. I want to thank also J.R.R. Tolkien, and also the fans that supported us on this journey. And of course Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne, whose courageous venture allowed us to make this film and their support throughout the journey. And Mark Ordesky, who worked alongside of us throughout and became a great friend. And of course to Peter Jackson, who was never satisfied with 100 percent, but by his example of pushing for 110 percent, he inspired all of us to do our utmost to make these films and bring them to the screen. And finally, to Weta, who is in Chicago [Sports CafŽ] in Wellington, New Zealand, and to the production team, who are in the Port Nicholson Yacht Club--it's time to celebrate.",2003,Best Picture,2003.17,http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/results.aspx?AC=NEXT_RECORD&XC=/results.aspx&BU=http%3A%2F%2Faaspeechesdb.oscars.org%2F&TN=aatrans&SN=AUTO8997&SE=1457&RN=1119&MR=0&TR=0&TX=1000&ES=0&CS=0&XP=&RF=WebReportList&EF=&DF=WebReportOscars&RL=0&EL=0&DL=0&NP=255&ID=&MF=oscarsmsg.ini&MQ=&TI=0&DT=&ST=0&IR=0&NR=314&NB=0&SV=0&SS=0&BG=&FG=&QS=&OEX=ISO-8859-1&OEH=utf-82003 (76th) Academy Awards,Short Film (Animated),Harvie Krumpet,Adam Elliot (accompanied on stage by producer Melanie Coombs),"Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson","February 29, 2004; Kodak Theatre","Wow.

Marty, thank you for your kind introduction, and to Jon Bloom for that wonderful film by the way. As many of you know, Marty's Film Foundation has been a leader in the film preservation movement, just as Jean Hersholt was a leader in the Motion Picture & Television Fund. And interestingly enough, he contributed the land on which our hospital, retirement community and Alzheimer's unit were built. So, there's a real connection there. As for film preservation, I must give credit to the six board chairmen [and] seven production heads during my twenty-five years at MGM who either backed our endeavors or weren't quite sure what we were doing so let it happen anyway. And then came Ted Turner and his cohorts in Atlanta, who understood the importance of all this and kept it going when funds were pretty short. Preservation and restoration are now led by the studios and organizations nationwide such as The Museum of Modern Art and Eastman House in New York, UCLA and our own Academy Archives here in Los Angeles, and most particularly, the Library of Congress. And as I thank the Academy's Board of Governors for this great honor, I want to remind all of you that the Academy itself, namely you, support film preservation and health care through both the Motion Picture & Television Fund and the National Film Preservation Foundation. So, we sincerely thank you.And of course, most importantly, thanks to my family, all of whom are here tonight. My children Patty and Larry, daughter-in-law Jennifer, sister Florence, granddaughters Natasha and Anna. And most especially, my wife of fifty-two-and-a-half years, Pauline. Fifty-two-and-a-half years; and they say nothing lasts in Hollywood? Well, love really does, ""Taking Care of Our Own"" does, and the art of film does if we properly preserve it.

Thank you. You're very kind and I thank you. From the time I did my first movie, I, needless to say, like everyone else, started to fantasize about Oscar. And I was lucky enough to be nominated on the first movie, so I started to fantasize about the speech. And I was a real smart aleck, and I thought I would say something like, ""I don't want to thank anybody; I did it alone."" It wasn't true, but I thought it would be a way of getting a little attention. When Frank Pierson called me about receiving this one, of course I started thinking about the speech again. And I realized that if I totaled up all of the ""thank yous"" that I've heard in all of these years, I wouldn't be able to thank all the people that I really want to. I'm not just talking about the glorious talents that I've worked with on both sides of the camera, but there are so many with whom I've never even worked that I owe so much. I mean, how do I thank Spielberg and Scorsese and Coppola? How do I thank Jean Vigo, and Carl Dreyer, and Willy Wyler, and Kurosawa, and Buster Keaton? And I'm not mentioning the ones that I really stole from. What about the Epsteins for writing a line like, ""Here's lookin' at you, kid?"" Or Wilder and Diamond for, ""Well, nobody's perfect."" Or Faragoh for, ""Mother of God, is this the end of Rico?""So, what I guess it comes down to is I'd like to thank the movies. I know that sounds general, but it's very real to me. I've got the best job in the best profession in the world, so I just want to thank all of it.And of course, the ones who've paid more dues than I have: Thank you Piedy, Amy, Jenny.

I thank our loyal lawyers Robert Thorne and Greg Redlitz. And finally I'm going to thank all the booksellers of the world. Remember that ""Brokeback Mountain"" was a book before it was a movie.

Thank you.  Thanks very much.  I've got a lot to say, and they've got a clock on me. I want to thank everybody for this, the Academy. I was really honored and moved to accept this award. When the news first came to me about it, I was caught kind of off guard. I always thought this type of award meant that it was over. And then it dawned on me that I was busy in rehearsals on a play that I'm doing in London right now. It opened last night, Arthur Miller's last play, ""Resurrection Blues."" I was doing an interview for my new film that I just finished, ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" which will come out in the summer. And I realized that it's not over. Of course I was happy and thrilled, and thrilled to accept this award. And I look at it as a nod to all of my films because, to me, I've just made one long film. And I know some of you have liked some of the sections, and others you.... Anyway, it's alright.And I want to thank all of the people that have worked on all my pictures so hard, the brilliant actors, the amazing crews. And I can't name them all so I'm going to name a doctor who is taking care of me, Jody Kaplan*. So she represents everybody who have supported me and made it possible.I've always said that making a film is like making a sandcastle at the beach. You invite your friends and you get them down there and you build this beautiful structure, several of you, and then you sit back and watch the tide come in. Have a drink, watch the tide come in and the ocean just takes it away. And that sandcastle remains in your mind. Now I've built about forty of them, and I never tire of it. No other filmmaker has gotten a better shake than I have. I'm very fortunate in my career. I've never had to direct a film I didn't choose or develop. I love filmmaking. It has given me an entree to the world and to the human condition and for that I'm forever grateful.Finally I'd like to thank my familyÑyou're all up there, all of them, almostÑfor their love and support through the years. And most importantly, I want to thank and applaud my wife Kathryn Reed Altman, without whom I wouldn't be here today. I love you, Trixie. Thank you.Oh, one more thing. I'm here, I think, under kind of false pretenses, and I think I have to become straight with you. Ten years ago, eleven years ago, I had a heart transplant. A total heart transplant. I got the heart of, I think, a young woman who was about in her late thirties, and so by that kind of calculation, you may be giving me this award too early. Because I think I've got about forty years left on it. And I intend to use it. Thank you very much.

Thank you.  Just a second, just a second.  Okay.  Take it [in], okay.  I wrote something down because I thought if it would happen I would be a little overwhelmed and I am.  So, okay. When I was a kid the only way that I saw movies was from the backseat of my family's car at the drive-in, and it wasn't my reality to think I would be acting in movies. So receiving this honor tonight tells me that it's possible, it is possible for a kid from east Texas, raised in South Central L.A., in Carson, who believes in his dreams, commits himself to them with his heart, to touch them and to have them happen. Because when I first started acting, it was because of my desire to connect to everyone, to that thing inside each of us, that light that I believe exists in all of us. Because acting for me is about believing in that connection; and it's a connection so strong, it's a connection so deep that we feel it and through our combined belief we can create a new reality.So I want to thank my fellow believers in ""The Last King of Scotland."" I want to thank Peter, Jeremy, Andrea, Lisa, Charles, Kevin, James McAvoy, Kerry, Stephen, Fox, DNA, Channel Four. I want to thank the people of Uganda, who helped this film have a spirit. And finally, I want to thank my mom and my dad; I want to thank my wife Keisha, my children, my ancestors who continue to guide my steps, and God, God who believes in us all and who's given me this moment in this lifetime that I will hopefully carry to the end of my lifetime into the next lifetime.

It's handwritten, it's short. More than anything I am deeply moved by the open-hearted appreciation our small film has received, which in these fragmented times speaks so openly of the possibility of innocence, growth and connection. Acting for me has always been and always will be a team sport. I cannot work at all unless I feel a spirit of unity around me. So my main sense of gratitude goes to the entire cast and crew and production team of ""Little Miss Sunshine"" for creating the same sense of joy and trust and community that the film speaks about.I'd like to thank the Academy, Fox Searchlight, my wife Suzanne, my sons Adam, Matthew and Tony for their endless support.

I'm still holding a grudge.But there's so many people to thank; not enough time. So I would like to thank what this film was about for me, which are the moms that take care of the babies and the children no matter where they come from. Those moms and parents never get thanked. I, in particular, failed to thank one. So... if I can take this moment to thank Helga B. for not letting me ride in cars with boys till I was eighteen, 'cause she was right; I would've done what she said I was gonna do. For making me practice every day when I got home, piano, ballet, whatever it is I wanted to be. She said to be an artist you had to practice every day. And for reminding her daughters that there's no race, no religion, no class system, no color, nothing, no sexual orientation, that makes us better than anyone else. We are all deserving of love.

So thank you so much to each and every member of the Academy for really honoring us beyond anything we could've imagined. Thank you to the Academy. This is really unreal and extremely humbling.

[Clutching the Oscar:] A man at last! [Laughs.] Well this is quite an event, I must say. This was something I never expected. I was in total shock when I got the call, and the shock has not quite worn off, I have to say.I've been very lucky in my life, probably luckier than I deserve. But to, at the age of nineteen, have been chosen by Howard Hawks to work in a film with a man named Humphrey Bogart, didn't thrill me too much when I heard it. I thought, Bogart, God...dese dem and dose guys, can't, you know... I thought that was not for me. He had said, ""Maybe Cary Grant."" I said, ""Well! Now you're talking."" But it ended up being Bogart; that was my great luck. Because he was not only a wonderful actor, but he was an extraordinary man. And he gave me a life and he changed my life. And he told me about all the ins and outs and ups and downs, of which there were many. And not so many downs with him. And from then on, I must say, for as many years as, I cannot believe sixty years, but it has been that long. [Laughs.] It's amazing, isn't it? Considering how young I am. Anyway. Miracles will never cease.The fact is that I've had the great good fortune of not only being shown the way by Bogie, and having two wonderful children who are right here, Steve and Leslie, right here with me, but in also being able to work with some of the best leading men in this business. And have forged the greatest friendships with Greg Peck, who I miss very much and love very dearly. And his wife got in the way, but what are you gonna do? [Laughs.] And anyway. Veronique, hello! [Laughs.]Anyway, I really was lucky. I really did work with, with Kirk Ð and he said, ""Never fear,"" he said to me backstage, ""Never fear, Kirk is here."" Confidence is a great thing, isn't it? But Kirk, and Duke Wayne, surprisingly had a marvelous relationship with him for two movies. And Greg. It's quite amazing the people that I've worked with. I've worked with Hank Fonda and met Ð unfortunately not really Jimmy Stewart, but some of the all-time all-time greats. And was directed by not only Howard Hawks, who was a marvelous director, a great movie director, but John Huston, of course, who was the great director and who showed me the way, and tripped me a few times en route. But he was a jokester, and because Ð and he loved to laugh, and he had an incredible laugh so one could hardly blame him.But anyway, not to tell you the entire story of my life, I just must say that I have to thank the Academy and I'm very grateful that they think I'm deserving of this honor. And as I repeat, I certainly did not expect to receive it, but I do welcome it. And the thought when I get home that I'm gonna have a two-legged man in my room is so exciting I can hardly stand it. So I would like to thank all of you, and I thank them. And, what else can I say? It's what I feel, and I feel very emotional and I feel very grateful, and not least of all that I'm still alive. I mean after all, some of you are surprised, aren't you? Nevertheless I am, and I'm here to stay. You better get used to the idea.

All other arts had their origins in antiquity and are therefore, to a certain extent, static. Motion pictures encompass movement, which is one of the key characteristics of our day, and for that reason they are modern. There's another reason as well. And the reason is that traditional art has been done, let us say, by composers, writers, poets, painters, who could create their art individually. Motion pictures require, the filmmaker requires a cast and a crew, and they must be paid. As a result our art is somewhat compromised. We're compromised between art and business and I think that represents something of the compromised world in which we live.I think that to succeed in this world you have to take chances. Many of my friends and compatriots and people who've started with me are here tonight, and they've all succeeded. Some of them succeeded to an extraordinary degree. And I believe they've succeeded because they had the courage to take chances, to gamble. But they gambled because they knew the odds were with them; they knew they had the ability to create what they wanted to make. It's very easy for a major studio or somebody else to repeat their successes, to spend vast amounts of money on remakes, on special effects-driven tentpole franchise films. But I believe the finest films being done today are done by the original, innovative filmmakers who have the courage to take a chance and to gamble. So I say to you: Keep gambling, keep taking chances.

I've done a lot of things in this business, but I've never worked for Roger Corman. And after I thought about it, it's the best thing that ever happened to him.

In retrospect, I think probably every good thing that's ever happened to me happened because of another person. And fifty-four years ago, I met this darling girl and married her, had three kids, now five grandchildren, and along the way I met this remarkable group of directors, producers, very fine actors, and very fine technicians who extended themselves for me.

My deepest thanks to the Academy.  I'm afraid I have to warn you that I'm experiencing stirrings, somewhere in the upper abdominals, which are threatening to form themselves into dance moves which, joyous as they may be for me, it would be extremely problematic if they make it to my legs before I get offstage.  So I'm going to do my best to be brief with my gratitude. First, for being on this extraordinary list of fellow nominees; something quite formidable and possibly the greatest honor of this. All the crew and my fellow cast members, those who are not here and those who are. Geoffrey, Helena, and Guy, whose virtuosity made it very, very difficult for me to be as bad as I was planning to be. And David Seidler, whose own struggles have given so many people the benefit of his very beautiful voice, and Tom Hooper, for the immense courage and clear sightedness with which he interpreted that. The men who finessed this to the screen: Gareth, Emile, Iain, Xavier, and of course Harvey, who first took me on twenty years ago when I was a mere child sensation.And all the people who have been rooting for me back home. Also Jessica Kolstad, my friend, Paul Lyon-Maris and Chris Andrews, for bearing with me through some of the less fortunate moments as well as the good ones. And my very fortunate friendship with Tom Ford who, to whom I owe a very big piece of this. And to the Anglo-Italian-American-Canadian axis which makes up my family.

It's impossible to describe what it feels like to be handed the same award that was given to Paddy Chayefsky thirty-five years ago for another movie with ""network"" in the title.  His was an original screenplay; this is an adaptation of a book by Ben Mezrich, so I'm accepting this on his behalf as well.

I wrote this movie but David Fincher made this movie, and he did it with an ungodly artfulness. Someone this talented has no business being the nicest guy in the world, but he is, and he made the movie of any screenwriter's dreams.

From Dana Brunetti, Ce‡n Chaffin, Mike De Luca, and America's best living film producer, Scott Rudin. And from Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, Armie Hammer again, Rashida Jones, Rooney Mara, and a cast and crew that followed their leader's example: that good enough was never good enough.

On behalf of all those film historians, film preservationists, and film collectors... I hear an intake of breath.  Not so long ago film collectors were endangered in this town by a knock on the door from the FBI.  I hope you have learnt that we were not your enemies.  But my god, your predecessors did a terrible job of preserving the silent era.  Historian David Pierce is about to reveal 73 percent has been destroyed.  Now, that's like a publisher taking Tolstoy, Dickens, Scott Fitzgerald, despulping every copy, and you can't even see the manuscript because they've burnt that as well.  So it's up to us to do our damnedest to find the films that your predecessors destroyed and bring them back into the canon.  An awful lot is being done as you know Š—– the recent find in New Zealand, the recent generosity from Russia Š—– but when I think of some of the titles that are gone it's really heartbreaking. Now, I was told when I started this business that silent films were a complete waste of time. They were jerky, flickery, ludicrously badly acted and appallingly photographed. And I couldn't understand it because I was already a film collector and what I saw in beautiful prints, although sometimes abridged, were... I was struck by the freshness, the vitality, the innovation and the exquisite photography. Ah, and I really do regret the loss of black and white. It was a beautiful medium. It called upon you to do some work, like silent film itself you have to supply the voices and sound effects, and with black and white you supply everything that the film suggested and therefore you become part of the creative process and it means that much more.Now, film is a collaborative medium and I took it to its extremes. I think I've worked on practically everything with a partner. My wife, of course, of forty-one years. She is wearing tonight jewelry given her by Alice Terry. Match that! Then there are my partners: Andrew Mollo, twelve years; David Gill, twenty-three years, alas he died in '97; and I'd better not leave out my current producer, Patrick Stanbury; and Christopher Bird, the most recent co-director.I've had a very fortunate life as you can guess. And to give you an example: I was very impressed by the feature comedies of Harold Lloyd. He seemed... If I wanted to convert someone to silent films I just ran them a Lloyd picture. That's all you had to do. But you could not get hold of them. He kept such close grasp that we were reduced to two for a long time, and I knew the fellow who had those two but he wouldn't even consider exchanging or selling them. Well, I wrote a fan letter to Harold Lloyd, and I was very disappointed. He didn't answer. Celebrities don't, you know. And I was dozing one Sunday morning and I imagined that I had at last gone to Hollywood, and I was being shown around the Motion Picture Home by D.W. Griffith himself. And he said, ""Over there is a room with a great cameraman. Over there lives a very fine editor."" And at the end of the corridor the telephone rang. And in my head I started tracking forward, as one does, and I dissolved through and my telephone was ringing. So I went out into the hall and picked it up and a voice said, ""Kevin, you'll never guess who this is. It's Harold Lloyd."" He invited me to the Dorchester Hotel, and then began a long and extremely fruitful friendship. I loved him! Actually, he was so charming he should have been the original of Dale Carnegie's ""How to Win Friends and Influence People.""And I became fascinated by what these people did. They were the most extraordinary people I've ever met in my life, when I finally got to America and met them en masse. It was not just the stars, but the cameramen, the art directors and even the title writers. I remember one of them, Monty Brice, told me that his first title writing job he was literally taken off the golf course. Somebody had fallen ill; none of the title writers were getting anywhere near a good joke. And so he came in in his rather loud knickerbockers, and these tough ex-newspapermen all looked at him and said, ""That's your title writing outfit, huh?"" And he said... he had no idea. What he had to produce was a title which suggested that Al St. John had left for the city, had failed in everything he'd done and was returning. He said to me, ""God send me a flash. I said, 'How 'bout this boys: Al left home to set the world on fire but had to come back for more matches.'""Now, it is amazing what's turning up, and if you would only relax your copyright laws where silent films are concerned you would see an awful lot more suddenly appear. That has been one of the worst chains on this whole affair of ours to try and rescue the past of the cinema. And I'll just tell you one terrible story which sums it all up. And I've got the film that Ð well, I shouldn't admit this because it's probably copyright Ð but I have the film in which this appears. Junior Laemmle was in charge of the Collegians series at Universal. And there's a sporting event, a swimming event, which one college wins and they build bonfires and they come home and have a wild party, or come back to the college and have the wild party, setting the bonfires alight. But it doesn't burn, they don't burn strongly enough. And Junior Laemmle says, ""Pile on the silent negatives; we'll never need them again."" And on that note, that cautionary tale, they burnt beautifully. I'll leave you.

Friends, family, ladies and gentlemen, members of the Academy:  Thank you.  Let me tell you a little about myself.  As an actor I've played more bandits, thieves, killers, warlords, molesters, and mafiosi than you could shake a stick at.  As a civilian I collect antique clocks, tell endless stories of my days as a medic in World War II, watch every tennis match, live for my family [and] daily mail, run the dishwasher, take pictures of faces in the bark of trees.  I really have a penchant for a man named Josh Brolin.  [Pointing:] There he is. Speaking of mail, sometimes I receive the most bizarre correspondence, ranging from an Englishman looking for help funding his mother's latest heart operation, to last year's letter from the Pope Ð really Ð gushing up to me for his favorite film was ""The Magnificent Seven."" I couldn't understand that, I kept killing people in there. And why not drop by for a visit the next time I'm in Rome. I didn't realize I had friends in such high places. I didn't even know I was joining the Academy for chrissake! On a more serious note, I'm deeply moved by this honor. Your recognition of my artistry makes something very [cl]ear to me: I don't act to live. I live to act.I have one last story to tell. Two young men were planning a gift for their elderly father's birthday so they decided to hire and send over a hooker. During negotiations she asks, ""How old is the birthday boy?"" ""Oh, he's in his nineties."" ""Oh, easy,"" she said, ""I can handle him easy."" So she goes over to the old man's house, knocks on his door. The old man opens it and says, ""Yes, what is it?"" So she smiles and says, ""I'm here to give you super sex."" And there's a slight pause, and he says, ""Alright, I'll take the soup.""",2010,Honorary Award,2010.27,http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/results.aspx?AC=NEXT_RECORD&XC=/results.aspx&BU=http%3A%2F%2Faaspeechesdb.oscars.org%2F&TN=aatrans&SN=AUTO8997&SE=1457&RN=1309&MR=0&TR=0&TX=1000&ES=0&CS=0&XP=&RF=WebReportList&EF=&DF=WebReportOscars&RL=0&EL=0&DL=0&NP=255&ID=&MF=oscarsmsg.ini&MQ=&TI=0&DT=&ST=0&IR=0&NR=314&NB=0&SV=0&SS=0&BG=&FG=&QS=&OEX=ISO-8859-1&OEH=utf-82010 (83rd) Academy Awards,Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award,No title.,Francis Ford Coppola,"Kathryn Bigelow, Don Novello, Roman Coppola, Sofia Coppola, Gia Coppola, Robert De Niro, George Lucas","November 13, 2010; The Governors Awards (Grand Ballroom, Hollywood & Highland Center)","Well, George [Lucas] is the closest thing I have to a younger brother, so you can imagine the affection and the pride I have in him.  But there were so many... I'm about three or four or five years older than the wonderful generation that did so much, so I'm very proud of them.  And the fact that this is the Thalberg Award is, the significance is not lost on me.  Because this is an award for producing.  This is not about my own writing and my own filmmaking, but this is about the talent that I came to really value.  And it's more about ""American Graffiti"" and ""The Black Stallion"" and ""Koyaanisqatsi,"" and I could go on, about ""Napoleon"" performed in the Radio City Music Hall with a live orchestra.  That happened because I'd always heard from my father that in the days when he was a boy, when he went to the movies to see ""Don Juan"" or ""The Thief of Bagdad,"" that there was a symphony orchestra.  And I said, gee, I'd love to see that.  And the way to see it was to take the ""Napoleon"" restoration and get a full-out symphony orchestra and perform it.  And it was a wonderful hit.  It was riveting.  And I'm so proud of the fact that that tradition of once again combining live music with the great silent films, or with any film, has become really something that we can see. I don't have any words prepared. In fact, I'm shooting a picture, and last night Ð we're shooting nights, so I went to bed around four in the morning last night. And I said, well, I'll just get up and thank everyone for this honor. I remember seeing the Thalberg Award given and thought, wow, that's fantastic. And in a way, although I still consider myself a relatively young person, I'm one of the few people you'll meet today who actually worked for Jack Warner and had him say, ""No fog on the lake!"" Or Sam Goldwyn when he said to me, you know, [imitating:] ""Your films, I like your films for the spontinuity"" [purposefully mispronounces], he said to me. So I had the pleasure Ð I do a great Samuel Goldwyn, as does Warren [Beatty]. He said to me, Samuel Goldwyn said to me, he said [imitating:] ""What are you doing? You're a Goldwyn Scholar. You're so great."" I said, well I want to direct, too. [Imitating:] ""Direct? You should be a writer. Writer, you are a writer. You're a great writer. Write! Write! Write!"" So a year later I made a film, and I got a letter: Mr. Goldwyn would like to see you. He said, [imitating:] ""Oh, you're a Goldwyn Scholar Ð"" This is really the way he talked, by the way, I'm not... [Imitating:] ""You're a Goldwyn Scholar."" He said, ""What are you doing?"" I said, well, I'm thinking of writing a new film. [Imitating:] ""Writing? You're a director now! Writers are nothing. Direct! Direct! Direct!"" So, you know, Adolph Zukor, Darryl Zanuck, who incidentally, as was said, was the first winner of the Thalberg Award, and I think he won it more than once as a matter of fact. So I have a great love of the original Hollywood tradition, certainly going back to the silents which were some of the most beautiful movies ever made. Murnau, by the way, had said himself, he said, ""The coming of sound to movies was inevitable, but it came too soon."" It came too soon, which there is some truth in. Those were beautiful films.I, you know, I'm so proud of my family: my wife of forty-eight years, Eleanor, who's here; my fabulous children. I made a very wise decision when I was a young guy. I said to my wife, if I ever go away for more than two weeks I want to take the kids out of school Ð imagine that today Ð take the kids out of school. I'm taking them with me. And we always did, and as a result we had our family together through all of those adventures in the Philippines and what have you. So, and then of course the other children in the Schwartzman family, and of course in, I can't say the Cage family, but we're very proud of Nicolas as you can imagine. So I could tell you lots of stories but I haven't prepared any notes or anything other than to thank you from the bottom of my heart. And my admiration for the tradition of Irving Thalberg and, of course, of the fantastic producers who have won it, and not the least of it is Dino. You know, what a loss, to lose... [imitating:] ""Dino, eh. You know, Francis..."" I don't do Dino so well. I think Warren does Dino. At any rate, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I thank my family. I thank my friends. So many of my friends are here tonight and people I've worked with, my colleagues, and the people whose films I've admired. Thank you so much.

I know you have been very kind to stay with us, you're a great audience this afternoon. I just wanna ask you a question: If an actor's nightmare is being on stage buck naked and not knowing his lines... what the heck do you call this?[Laughs] I mean, look at this! I've been on this stage, with a great audience - and thank you. I had my clothes on, I knew my words, and then out from the wings steps Sir Ben Kingsley, and he hands me an Oscar! Frankly... frankly, what the heck else would you call that but an actor's wet dream? [Laughs]And aside from that, how do I feel? Well, I'm more than flabbergasted. There's a word I've learned here in Britain. They'd say, ""I'm gobsmacked!"" [Laughs] And that's the only word that I can think of that's appropriate for this improbable moment in my life. Improbable because, well, let's start with my introduction to motion pictures. Four years old, sitting on a bench in the dark in Mississippi. Two storekeepers have taken a bedsheet and stretched it between their stores. One sells popcorn, the other sells soda pop. Is that familiar? And when those images start emitting sound on that bedsheet, and the shootouts and the fisticuffs start, I simply can't handle it. And I dive under the bench in terror, begging, screaming, ""Make 'em stop! Somebody make 'em stop doing that.""Well, I can't make 'em stop so eventually I joined them. And for half a century now, being a journeyman actor in my own fashion, I still spend more time on [taps the stage with his foot] boards like these than in front of cameras like those [pointing to the back of the room]. I sometimes feel like that lone wolf lurking around the, outside the glow of the cinema campfire, lurching in to snatch a morsel of movie now and then. Now sometimes those morsels I'm quite proud of. But you cannot be a cinema actor and conduct your career like I've done, and not end up in some of the worst movies ever committed to celluloid. But I want to tell you something [laughs], I want to tell you something. I so cherish them that I refuse to name them. You'll just have to Google, my friends, because tonight belongs to Oscar.I want to thank the Academy, the Board of Governors. I want to thank Mr. Sid Ganis for flying my little golden friend over the ocean. And thank you, Sir Ben Kingsley, for presenting it to me.

Because Maria is so correct, it's very difficult for me to open myself to receive what people have to offer. And so tonight I came prepared to be open, and I would like to thank the Board of Governors for the opportunity to receive the love, and the Oscar. I never imagined myself receiving an Oscar, certainly not for doing what I believe is a part of my calling, is a part of my being. It's a part of why I am here. And what I know for sure is the only reason I am here is because Quincy Jones was in a hotel in Chicago in 1985, and was taking a shower, and was there for a lawsuit, that somebody was suing Michael Jackson saying that they were the girl of the song, or whatever. And he saw me on ""A.M. Chicago"" and said, ""I think that's Sofia."" So I would like to thank Quincy Jones, who is in Dubai right now.But Quincy Jones was a part of a divine manifestation for me. Those of you, anybody here who's ever watched ""The Oprah Show"" has heard me tell the story of how I first watched, first read The New York Times review on a Sunday about ""The Color Purple."" I read the review, because the book review is the first thing I ever look at on The New York Times. And Stedman and I to this day, it's like, ""You want the book review?"" I go, ""You read the front section. I'll read the book review first."" And I read the book review of ""The Color Purple."" And was in my pajamas, put on my coat, in Baltimore, and went to the bookstore and got the book. And from that moment became, literally, drawn to, in some kind of mystical way, to that story. Mainly because the character... The first line of the book is, ""Dear God, I'm fourteen years old..."" And I had lived that life and couldn't imagine that someone was able to put into words what I had already experienced.And so began this journey that I was able to really understand that God's hand, or power greater than myself, ""the forces,"" as Sidney Poitier calls them, were engaged in leading my life to a plane and a level that I had not even imagined. But I released myself to those forces, and literally said inside myself, ""Thy will be done."" And as a part of that journey, to be here tonight... Maria touched on it but it is really -- Stedman and I talk about this all the time. It's unimaginable if you are not a black, former colored girl, born in Mississippi in 1954, it's impossible for you to even know what this journey has meant. I know Larry Gordon, Mississippi Jew [laughs], almost as rare as I am [laughs], can begin to understand what that means, to be born in 1954 in Mississippi.When I saw ""The Help,"" and first heard that there was gonna be a movie called ""The Help,"" and first read the book, ""The Help,"" I thought that is my story. My grandmother was a maid. Her mother was a maid. The mother before her was a slave. My mother was a maid. My grandmother's greatest dream for me was that I would grow up in a family and have a career where... She used to say, ""I hope you get some good white folks. I hope you get some good white folks like I have. I have good white folks."" And the only picture I have of my grandmother is of her holding a white child in her maid's uniform. So, the journey from Kosciusko, Mississippi, where nobody ever even imagined it possible that you could be anything other than a maid who had some good white folks, who would give you clothes and would let you take food home on the holidays. It's unimaginable that I would be standing before you, voted by the Board of Governors... It's unimaginable. It's unimaginable. It's unimaginable. It is unimaginable! And so when I say thank you, the thank you comes from a place deeper than even I know, Sharon [Stone]. Even deeper than I know. Because it's not just from me, it's from everybody who made me possible. It's from every shoulder I ever stood on, every bridge I ever crossed, every story that's ever told, every story that ever imagined this day to be possible.I thank you for this award. And I will... What this means for me is, I woke up this morning, I said, ""What is Oscar? What is a... Oscar...?"" You know, I grew up wanting to be an actress and my father, being a barber and coming from the culture that he came from, said, ""No daughter of mine's going to be laying on some casting couch."" That was his idea of what being an actress meant. And so when the opportunity showed itself to me, to be a part of ""The Color Purple,"" it really is, was divine intervention, just to be a part of being able to share that story. I knew that something special, magical, a door had opened to me. And after that door came ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" and many other doors. But a door opened to me through the magic and majesty of film. The ability to tell stories in such a way that you connect to the heart-space of people, and you connect to the place where people really live, and not just live but where their souls abide, that is what great films do. And to this day, ""The Color Purple"" experience is one of the greatest experiences of my life.And yes, I'd like to do more films, but to receive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award means more to me than any film, any acclaim, even an Oscar. Because what it says is that you all get it. The Board of Governors, you get it. You get that what I've been trying to do and what I've been trying to say all these years is that every single person, Ayanna, and all of you and every person I've spoken to in over fifty thousand interviews of ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" every single person who incarnates here to the planet matters. Your life matters. You matter. What you do matters. The fact that you are here, that you are born, that your presence here on earth means something. That's what I've been trying to say through all of my work, be it film, be it ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" be it the magazine, it is that we all matter. And what I really, really, really, really know for sure, is that this award to me represents all of you, sitting in a room -- I don't know how this happens. The governors, I don't know who you are. But when I got the call from Tom [Sherak] I was literally on a hike in Hawaii, and I get the call. The Academy has called! Security comes for me and says, ""You must come down from the mountain now! Stop the hike because Tom from the Academy is on the phone."" And then Larry Gordon is saying, ""Answer the phone! Answer the phone!"" And I'm like, whaaat...? Okay! What this really means is that you all understand that what I've been trying to do and what I've tried to say all these years, is that all us can make a difference through the life that we live.And when you understand, as I do, that this to me, I'm gonna allow this Oscar... Like I've interviewed everybody over the years and say, ""Where do you keep your Oscar?"" And people are always so nonchalant about it and they say: ""Oh my, I keep it in my bathroom."" ""I don't know where mine is."" ""My sister has it."" Well my new sister, my sister who I just discovered last year, this time last year, is here. Pat is here. I will say she will not have it; I will have it! And it will be on, I will keep it on my desk in front of me to remind me that you have voted for me. You have voted for what I believe is the essence of why we're all here. We're all here to help each other. We're all here to use our lives in service to one another. And nobody who has ever, ever done any kind of work... I mean I run a girls school and those girls are gonna be graduating from college. The first in their families to ever graduate from college. The first in their families to ever graduate high school. And those girls are coming to the United States and they're going to Wellesley and they're going to Brown and they're going to Tufts and they're going to all the great universities. And I will tell you that anybody who's ever done that, done any kind of work where you are hands on, where you're up on the phone and you're on at four o'clock in the morning and two in the morning and whatever, you're not doing that because you think you're gonna get an Oscar one day. You're doing it because you believe in the power of every human being who has come to this planet. And you know that these are all bodies, but inside the bodies there's a soul and a spirit and a power greater than we know. And for me this Oscar will represent love from all of you. I thank you for your vote of love and I will use it to increase the open space in my heart to continue to do the great and good work that we've all come to do and serve. Thank you so much.",2011,Honorary Award,2011.27,http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/results.aspx?AC=NEXT_RECORD&XC=/results.aspx&BU=http%3A%2F%2Faaspeechesdb.oscars.org%2F&TN=aatrans&SN=AUTO8997&SE=1457&RN=1337&MR=0&TR=0&TX=1000&ES=0&CS=0&XP=&RF=WebReportList&EF=&DF=WebReportOscars&RL=0&EL=0&DL=0&NP=255&ID=&MF=oscarsmsg.ini&MQ=&TI=0&DT=&ST=0&IR=0&NR=314&NB=0&SV=0&SS=0&BG=&FG=&QS=&OEX=ISO-8859-1&OEH=utf-82012 (85th) Academy Awards,Actor in a Leading Role,Lincoln,Daniel Day-Lewis,Meryl Streep,"February 24, 2013; Dolby Theatre","I really don't know how any of this happened. I do know that I've received so much more than my fair share of good fortune in my life and I'm so grateful to the Academy for this beautiful honor. It's a strange thing because three years ago, before we decided to do a straight swap, I had actually been committed to play Margaret Thatcher... and Meryl was Steven's first choice for Lincoln. And I'd like to see that version. And Steven didn't have to persuade me to play Lincoln but I had to persuade him that perhaps, if I was going to do it, that ""Lincoln"" shouldn't be a musical. My fellow nominees, my equals, my betters, I'm so proud to have been included as one amongst you. When we got married sixteen years ago Ð or since we got married sixteen years ago Ð my wife Rebecca has lived with some very strange men.

Ruddy","December 1, 2012; The Governors Awards (Ray Dolby Ballroom, Hollywood & Highland Center)","Ah man. When I found out I was gonna receive this award they said, who do want to speak on your behalf. The first name out of my mouth, Al Ruddy. And I knew it. Because he's got more funny stories Š—– but when you're a director that's not all good, because he's got the damn cast over here telling 'em stories and I'm waiting on him. I'd say, Ruddy, let 'em up. He'd let 'em up, they'd come over. Once I cut, they'd be back over listening to Ruddy. [To Ruddy next to him on stage:] Are you gonna stand here and listen to me or are you gonna sit down? Thank you. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. You know something? You're looking at the luckiest man alive. And lucky to be alive. As a kid folks didn't think too much of me, of what I was gonna amount to. The reason, I was a sharecropper's son, way back in the hills of Arkansas during the Great Depression. With eight years of education. But for sure, for sure, my mom is looking down on tonight with a big smile on her face Ð sorry. By 1954, I'd served three years in the military as a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division where I made over four hundred jumps. Most of those jumps were made testing parachutes. And on a lot of weekends I worked an aerial thrill show, which is perfect training for my first movie, ""The Spirit of St. Louis,"" that starred Jimmy Stewart. They were prepared to shoot a barnstorming sequence, all they needed was two guys to work on top of and underneath a couple of biplanes. The production manager was talking to my partner and I about how much we're going to charge them for the first stunt. Hell, I didn't know. I'd never done it before. I had no idea what'd be appropriate. But trying to get as much as I could I said, two thousand dollars every time we do it. A voice behind me said, ""For two thousand dollars I'll do it."" I looked around, it was the director, Billy Wilder. He walked past us, went down to the planes, climbed up on the top wing, buckled in. I said, this fool's got to be kidding. But he wasn't. He motioned the pilot to wind it up and took off. They bounced down across the field, made a couple of low passes and landed. When Billy Wilder climbed down off of that plane he says Ð he had a twinkle in his eye and a little smile on his face Ð and he said, ""Now how much do you want?"" We agreed that a thousand dollars would be just right. I worked six weeks on ""Spirit"" when they paid me more money than this cotton-pickin' kid had seen in his life. I now had a decision, a goal. I was gonna be a Hollywood stuntman.When I got into the business the stunt equipment was, adequate. I know, because I broke fifty-six bones, my back twice, punctured a lung, had a shoulder replaced and knocked out a few teeth trying to use that stuff. But never believing that and the fact that that's the way it's always done, I came up with a few pieces of equipment that made the stunts more real, more active and a lot, lot easier. Safer. And that's really what I was looking for. A way to save myself some trips to the hospital.You know, I didn't get here by myself; I had a lot of help. A lot of help. And I need to thank some of those folks. Like all the stuntmen and women who worked with me and for me, and made me look like I knew what I was doing. All the producers, directors, and stars that requested me. The Academy Board of Governors, for deciding to give me this award, this great award. And my wife Ellyn, for putting up with me for all these years, nursing me back to health many times, but best of all, the neverending love. Honey, you're the best; thank you. One last thing. I want to thank the entire Hollywood community for allowing me to be part of it. Thank you very much.

Pennebaker, who redefined the language of film and taught a generation of filmmakers to look to reality for inspiration.","Al Franken, Michael Moore","December 1, 2012; The Governors Awards (Ray Dolby Ballroom, Hollywood & Highland Center)","I'm gonna put some notes out here, but hopefully I won't get lost in them. [Looking at the Oscar:] Kind of amazing. I mean I... Everybody here probably has one of these already, right? I'm the last one to get it. Alright, well, I want to thank Hawk Koch who called me up Š—– I thought it was early in the morning but Chris says it was late at night Š—– and told me he was from the Academy and that they were gonna give me one of these. And I did say, are you kidding? It seems, you know, New York is a long way from here. And people in New York who make films never expect to even go to Oscarland, much less get one. So it's kind of a... I mean, and there's also the distance between the 16mm film and the 35mm, and the 40mm, and the 70mm, and whatever. So it's a long stretch, and being here now, I'm kinda trying to deal with it. It's hard. Anyway, I have to thank the Board of Governors who made this possible. And I want to thank Ð well I want to congratulate Jeffrey Katzenberg, whom I just met. Actually we almost met in New York at a screening, but not quite. He was a few rows ahead of me and we were all getting out. Hal Needham, whom I don't know. And George Stevens whom I know from long ago when I was on an NEA panel. And I think he was getting some funding from that panel, so we got to go for two or three days out here, and he arranged a really nice thing with starlets and... It was interesting. It was great. I liked him for that. And then I... And Michael Moore, who probably is responsible for everything that's happening here tonight, as far as I can see, but whom, you know... I mean I, Michael's amazing. He's like Chaplin. He's created a kind of... The minute you see the hat and his head you know exactly what's gonna happen. That's fantastic. You know, very few people can do that. I think that's called branding. Anyway he, just knowing that Michael's on the case I sleep better, that's all I can tell you. And I love him. He's just, well, he's a man who is passionate about seeing fairness take place, and that's a hard thing in our time.Anyway. And Bobby Neuwirth, who's somewhere here. He was Dylan's road manager. And I met him with Bobby down at this bar in the Village. That was when Dylan'd say I have an idea for doing a film whereby I'll take some pieces of cardboard and we'll write things on, I'll write words from a song on 'em, and I'll throw them down. Is that a good idea? And I said, it's a fantastic idea. So we brought about a thousand shirt cardboards with us to England when we made the film there. And the thing Neuwirth was, from the very beginning, and this is always amazing. It's like meeting your, the woman you're gonna marry or the child that you want to raise. He knew somehow instinctively exactly what I was gonna do. And he often made it happen; he made it possible. He didn't arrange anything or direct anything, but he was willing whatever we needed to happen. And that was the first time I'd ever run across that. Actually, it was the first time I'd made a movie about a person with dialog, so there were a lot of new things going on there for me.Anyway, the person that I have to thank the hardest is the love of my life, Chris, whom when I first met her, she was looking for a job. She said Ð but later I think, I decided she was really looking to get her hands on my camera, which I thought was reasonable. And I right away could see that she could be the partner that I really always was looking for. The person who had the same, was driven by the same passion for a certain kind of film that I was. And that's thirty-six years ago, and we haven't changed... Although when we make a film Ð yeah, give her a hand. She's so beautiful; she spent two hours getting made up tonight and she looks fantastic. Anyway, she and I have made a lot of films together. We made, of course, ""The War Room"" with Nick Doob, who I think is here. And when we make films, when you, shooting them you're great friends. Because there's nothing but problems to be solved, so you're pals. And then you sit down at either the Steenbeck, or whatever editing machine there is, and it all begins. You get divorced about four times a week. But you know, it's a process. Even though you're practically choking each other to death over each editing decision, there's nothing in the world I love better than doing that with her. It's just my favorite thing. So even if I had nothing else to do, that would be the thing I would choose that would be the best fun. So anyway, that's, she knows all about this because I tell her all the time.And we also... Al and Chris together made the film with Al Franken, with Nick Doob and Al Franken. And that was the Ð well I tell ya, I was really surprised when Al came up and introduced me there. That was... he's such a... Well that's an interesting film. I mean, I don't know if any of you've seen it. I mean, I've seen it a lot of times, but... I was, for that film I was the producer. And any of you who make documentary film know the role of the producer. I might as well have stayed home; I don't do very much. But they made a fantastic film. And I think that when, you know, the thing about it was that here was a guy who was invited to parties because he'd make everybody laugh. He was kind of a party clown and he had been an originator of SNL, so he was really very good at it. You know, he, but he was also a person who could see when things were going wrong, and he could see who the problems were and who was doing it. And so in the course of that film Ð and boy, it's very seldom you make a film about somebody and see them change, really change their lives. That's like magic happening. And he decided he was gonna run for the Senate. And it's, and there was this story he told which was, it wasn't really a dirty story but it had kind of dirty implications you would say. I mean you wouldn't want your five-year-old to tell it in school. And he used to tell it at big gatherings like this and everybody would laugh and laugh. And somebody said to him, ""You're running for Senate now, you can't tell that story."" And he said ""What! I can't tell that story? What's wrong with that story?"" ""Can't do it."" ""Okay,"" he said. ""I won't tell that story."" And that was the end of the film. But you know it was such an amazing thing Ð I hear him laughing out there. It was such an amazing thing because he would do anything. He saw that being a Senator was so much more important than anything he'd ever done before that he was ready to even not tell that story. And I thought that was a show of character that I really loved.Anyhow. Beyond that I think, we made a film with Roger Friedman. It was called the, ""Only the Strong Survive."" It was sort of an interesting thing, because Roger is a New York Jew. And to all the musicians in Memphis, he was the enemy, right? The New York Jew came out and stole their music and never gave them any money back. And when Roger arrived in Memphis, we thought, well, we'll have a little problem. They loved Roger! Because he's seen, he knew every song they ever sang and he'd been at every concert they'd ever seen. They, the people were not very interested in us because they didn't know who we were. We were just two filmmakers from New York. But seeing Roger in that atmosphere and to follow him from the kind of talent that Stax and all those various music originators came up with was, well it was very exciting for me. It was the kind of music I didn't know much about. And at the end of that film I really felt like I'd been through some kind of a college course in something or other. And Roger did it. We just followed Roger. We didn't know what to look at or who to listen to, and he took us to those places. So I'm very grateful to what he was able to do. And still, you know, for my birthday party he said, ""I got a surprise for you. Aretha Franklin is coming to your party."" And she did. We sat down; I talked for a half an hour to Aretha Franklin. And I'll never get over that; that was my birthday present from Roger.Well anyway. And then I have to thank my family. A horde of people sitting at a table over there. And I think at least one grandchild and one on the way. Chelsea, she's about to whelp. And you know, that my family all, we, I tell you it's grown so, I think I have eight children and then I think I have thirteen or fourteen Ð I'm not sure which Ð grandchildren. So Thanksgivings are impossible. And this is the first time we've all been sitting together. It's kind of wonderful. It's a family reunion, and that's kind of nice. And then there's Frazer, my son [applause] Ð yeah, right. Who by some magic of DNN, DNA Ð whatever it is Ð has managed to be older than I am. So he's our boss and runs our company, and has, which he's done successfully for thirty-five years or so. For us success is, you know, not cashing huge amounts of money at the bank but being able to make the next film. Because it takes us a little longer to make a film than maybe we should. You know, we have to argue and fight over it, and that, you know, it's always difficult. And he's made that so that happens. You know, even if he wasn't my son I would have to be very grateful and loving to him because that's an amazing thing to do. That's an act of love.And then there's people that I've worked with. Jim Desmond who, with Nick Proferes, two people who had kind of, were neophytes in our organization. They'd just come to work with us to find out how these films were made. And when we were at Monterey, I thought, Ravi Shankar? Who's Ravi Shankar? You know, nobody here is gonna be interested in this music. So I said, you guys can go film Ravi Shankar music and all the rest of us heavy filmmakers will film the people in the audience. The L.A. factions and the San Francisco factions were sort of making peace but also heavily at war. And halfway through that thing that they did, which was a fantastic piece of music, I began... Everybody was really intent on listening and I could hear that it was kinda more than I thought it was gonna be, so I said, I'd better go down and see how those guys are doing. And I went down in the front and there the two of them were just gunning it. They were so, I was thrilled just watching them film. And I didn't even know what they were getting, but I could see that they were really into it. So I was able to film the audience. I didn't even bother to do anything. And that's, when I looked at the rushes I saw that that film that they had shot was the, was gonna be the ending of the film. It was the most exciting thing that we'd done there. And the thing that was amazing, and I tell students to watch that sequence and you'll see two people learning how to be filmmakers in less than an hour. And it's an amazing thing to watch because they, in the beginning they weren't sure what to shoot. And by the end they were just so right on it that it's hair-raising. And that was those, that was Nick and Jim Desmond.And then I think the one person that was very instrumental in my education as a filmmaker was Bobby Neuwirth. And he sort of knew how to function in a group of people without disturbing them, and yet watching what they really did, not what they pretended to do. And that was something that I needed to learn because I had never really filmed a number Ð most of my films were like ""Daybreak Express."" I just got Duke Ellington music, and you can't, you know, what can you do worse than that?And then I think later that we worked with Joan Churchill and Alan Barker, and we did a film ""Searching for Jimi Hendrix."" And it was so marvelous to have somebody that I knew on the other coast so we didn't have to Ð we had no budget for it so we couldn't come flying out here to do something. And Joan and Alan, what they did was just as good as anything we could have done. So it taught me that people were learning and getting as good as they needed to and that was a very exciting possibility. And then one day R.J. Cutler and Wendy Ettinger came to visit us, and neither of them had ever made a film Ð am I going too long, do you think? I don't want to overwhelm this thing here. But, alright, well anyway. They had never made a film and they said why aren't you making a film about this election. And we said, what election? You know. And so they really knew Ð well, I'm getting mixed signals from my family here. And they said... we said, well we don't have any money and we don't know anybody there. And at this point I think Clinton was in fourth place in New York. So even though my enthusiasm was for Clinton I didn't see how I could make that into a film. And they said, we'll get you a little money, which they did. And we'll find out, we'll call up and get you some people to let you in. And they did that and we made ""The War Room"" with them. And that was sort of a marvelous thing. You're saying... Oh, alright.So anyway, I want to say I'm really grateful for this amazing award. And what it tells me, or what I get from it is that, as kind of a foreigner from New York who all my life, you know, everything I learned about films was in watching the movies that you people out here made. I mean, that's my education in film. And that watching those films and thinking about this award has made me feel that finally, between here and New York, there's finally some kind of a bridge. And that you guys all somehow now consider us fellow filmmakers. And that's wonderful. Thank you.",2012,Honorary Award,2012.27,http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/results.aspx?AC=NEXT_RECORD&XC=/results.aspx&BU=http%3A%2F%2Faaspeechesdb.oscars.org%2F&TN=aatrans&SN=AUTO8997&SE=1457&RN=1364&MR=0&TR=0&TX=1000&ES=0&CS=0&XP=&RF=WebReportList&EF=&DF=WebReportOscars&RL=0&EL=0&DL=0&NP=255&ID=&MF=oscarsmsg.ini&MQ=&TI=0&DT=&ST=0&IR=0&NR=314&NB=0&SV=0&SS=0&BG=&FG=&QS=&OEX=ISO-8859-1&OEH=utf-82012 (85th) Academy Awards,Honorary Award,No title.,"To George Stevens, Jr., a tireless champion of the arts in America and especially that most American of arts: the Hollywood film.","Annette Bening, Sidney Poitier","December 1, 2012; The Governors Awards (Ray Dolby Ballroom, Hollywood & Highland Center)","Thank you so much. And thank you, dear Sidney, and wonderful Annette. Sitting out here with all of you enjoying this wonderful evening, it made me think back to the first time I saw one of these. It was a long time ago. It was in, it was on March 15, 1944. I was eleven years old. My father was away at war, preparing for D-Day. He'd been nominated for directing for a movie called ""The More the Merrier."" And I was planning on going to a twi-night double-header between the Hollywood Stars and the San Francisco Seals down at Gilmore Field over there on Beverly. And my mother told me that instead we were going to Grauman's Chinese and that if my father won this award I was going to accept it. I remember putting on an itchy suit and going to the Chinese with my mother and my grandmother. And my mother saying that, how gracious the stars sitting around us were Ð Jean Arthur, Jennifer Jones, Ingrid Bergman Ð when the other's picture would win for art direction or sound, and they would applaud, and it was so nice. And then a fine director of the day, Mark Sandrich, came on the stage to present the award for best director. And I was ready. But you should understand this. I knew the batting averages of every player in the Hollywood Stars' lineup, but I had never heard of ""Casablanca."" Mark Sandrich read the names, opened the envelope, and he said: Michael Curtiz, ""Casablanca."" And unlike the gracious ladies sitting around me Ð my mother said that I had a deep and rather resonant voice for a boy my age Ð I said, ""We wuz robbed!""Well you see, I mean, I didn't grow up to come here. I wanted to be a sportswriter. My heroes were Grantland Rice and Red Smith. And maybe it was partly a little thing of self-preservation, that I didn't want to devote my life to becoming the second-best film director in my family. But, it a... you know, I had this legacy. My grandmother, Georgia Woodthorpe, was the great actress of the age in San Francisco. She played ""Ophelia"" to Edwin Booth's ""Hamlet."" And her daughter, Georgie Cooper, married Landers Stevens. They were both actor and actress matinee idols in San Francisco, and Landers was a director. And when the movies ruined the theater they moved to Hollywood. The next time you see ""Swing Time,"" that handsome, grey-haired man who plays the father of the girl that Fred Astaire stands up at her wedding, that's Landers Stevens. And my other grandmother, Alice Howell, she came here and starred in the first six films that Charlie Chaplin made and went on to make a hundred more. And my mother, she was a Mack Sennett bathing beauty until she retired to raise me. So, it's sort of in our blood. And my daughter Caroline is here; she's a documentary filmmaker. My son Michael is a writer-producer-director. He's in Washington tonight, producing the Kennedy Center Honors. Probably making me irrelevant. And so they are fifth generation in show business. Which makes Liz and me especially proud of our son David, with his doctoral degree from Harvard and his company called Symphony Learning, he is teaching children to learn. And at long last he has proven that a Stevens can make a living in the real world. David.I went back to the Oscars years later, this time with my father, and I sat next to him the night he won for ""A Place in the Sun."" And riding home that night, he was driving the car Ð it was different in those days Ð and the Oscar was on the seat between us. And I was pretty excited. And I think he thought I was a little too excited. He leaned over, smiled, and he said something that shaped my life. He said, we'll have a better idea what kind of a film this is in about twenty-five years. He was talking about the test of time. And it was the test of time that was the underlying idea and the ethic of the American Film Institute and later the Kennedy Center Honors. So I thank Dad for that and for opening the door for me to a creative life that has been so rich and gifted me with so many wonderful friends in our profession. And the test of time, I've seen a couple of pictures this fall that I am confident will stand the test of time. And I think it is so important that there are filmmakers among us who will swim into the currents, who will challenge the industrialization of moviemaking to make films that are filled with passion and glory and pity and sacrifice, and reached to the depths of our humanity. And so thinking of that I thank the Academy, I thank the Board of Governors. And this means a great deal to me because of our shared values about the importance and the value of film. So tonight I say, here's to the great films of the future. And I should add, tonight I wasn't robbed. Thanks so much.",2012,Honorary Award,2012.28,http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/results.aspx?AC=NEXT_RECORD&XC=/results.aspx&BU=http%3A%2F%2Faaspeechesdb.oscars.org%2F&TN=aatrans&SN=AUTO8997&SE=1457&RN=1365&MR=0&TR=0&TX=1000&ES=0&CS=0&XP=&RF=WebReportList&EF=&DF=WebReportOscars&RL=0&EL=0&DL=0&NP=255&ID=&MF=oscarsmsg.ini&MQ=&TI=0&DT=&ST=0&IR=0&NR=314&NB=0&SV=0&SS=0&BG=&FG=&QS=&OEX=ISO-8859-1&OEH=utf-82012 (85th) Academy Awards,Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,No title.,Jeffrey Katzenberg,"Will Smith, Ruthie Tompson, Tom Hanks","December 1, 2012; The Governors Awards (Ray Dolby Ballroom, Hollywood & Highland Center)","Thank you. Thank you first to the Academy and the Board. This is a truly great honor. And I have to thank both Tom and Will. To receive this award from two of our greatest talents and two people I am lucky to be able to call my friends is a distinct honor of its own, as it is to be here among movie legends Mr. Pennebaker, George Stevens and Hal Needham. My story is of mentors. People who give of their time and their talents, of their words and their wisdom. People who encourage all of us to reach for more and in doing so inspire us. Inspire us to strive for exellence not only in ourselves but in each other. My first mentors, my parents, they gave me life and they gave me a deep appreciation for what it is to give to others. There are days between my second and third breakfasts when I think how lucky I was to have been mentored at such an early age. My mom, she passed away a little over a month ago, and I really regret that I never told her this enough. But my father is here tonight and, Dad, I want to say now just how much you mean to me and how much I love and appreciate you for all you have given to me.Mentors. John Lindsay, the late, great mayor of New York, taught me the power of believing. Believing in an ideal. For when he looked out across a sea of problems and people in need, most of whom asked for nothing, said he wanted to try and make their world just a little bit better. And he did. This was an early lesson and a simple truth that each of us can and should make a difference.Kirk Douglas. I met Kirk, as most of the world did, larger than life on a giant silver screen. Spartacus, a true hero. Then I had the honor of meeting him in real life and he was an even larger hero in person. It's Kirk who taught me you haven't learned to live until you've learned to give. It's a statement that echoes loudly and it is in many ways the mantra of Hollywood. Think of George Clooney and the Sudan. Think of Steven Spielberg and Shoah. Think of Angelina Jolie and the United Nations. Think of David Geffen, well, everything. The list is long and I am honored to be among the many.In fact, standing here alone doesn't feel quite right to me. It projects a bit of a false image. Because mostly all I did was pick up the phone and ask you. It's you who did it. You who give of your time, your talent, your money, your hearts. Because that's what you do, that is what Hollywood does. And I know what it is to be asked. I was asked by Lew and Edie Wasserman, mentors. They asked me to take a moment to consider the Motion Picture Television Fund, and the ask was all that it took. A place to care for many of our nation's great artists and storytellers, a place for mentors to be safe and to be appreciated. You saw their faces, heard their voices in that video, and there is so much more. I stand here tonight on their behalf with particular pride because this award bears the name of Jean Hersholt. It was he nearly seventy-five years ago who was among the founders of the Motion Picture Relief Fund. I'm tempted to say it's the circle of life, but a circle implies something complete and we at the Fund have a greater horizon.I will end with my thanks to the person who is every single day my greatest mentor. We met back in the John Lindsay days and we are here today as partners in giving and partners in living. The mother of my amazing children, she is my wife, and she is my life. Marilyn. And to all of you, I want to thank you again for giving so generously of your time, of your talent and of your hearts. You might say that all of us who work in the film industry, we actually live in two worlds. There's the imaginary world we project on the screen and then there's the real world that we live in every day. All of the other Oscars, they pay tribute to the talent that goes into the creation of those imaginary worlds. I believe this particular Hersholt Award is a recognition of the extraordinary generosity of our industry towards improving the real world that we all share. And it is with that in mind and, I think, really on your behalf that I humbly and proudly accept this amazing recognition. Thank you so very much.",2012,Honorary Award,2012.29,http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/results.aspx?AC=NEXT_RECORD&XC=/results.aspx&BU=http%3A%2F%2Faaspeechesdb.oscars.org%2F&TN=aatrans&SN=AUTO8997&SE=1457&RN=1366&MR=0&TR=0&TX=1000&ES=0&CS=0&XP=&RF=WebReportList&EF=&DF=WebReportOscars&RL=0&EL=0&DL=0&NP=255&ID=&MF=oscarsmsg.ini&MQ=&TI=0&DT=&ST=0&IR=0&NR=314&NB=0&SV=0&SS=0&BG=&FG=&QS=&OEX=ISO-8859-1&OEH=utf-82013 (86th) Academy Awards,Actor in a Leading Role,Dallas Buyers Club,Matthew McConaughey,Jennifer Lawrence,"March 2, 2014; Dolby Theatre","Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you to the Academy for this, all six thousand members. Thank you to the other nominees. All these performances were impeccable in my opinion; I didn't see a false note anywhere. I want to thank Jean-Marc Vall’©e, our director. I want to thank Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner, who I worked with daily. There's a few things, about three things, to my account that I need each day. One of 'em is something to look up to. Another is something to look forward to. And another is someone to chase. Now, first off, I want to thank God, 'cause that's who I look up to. He has graced my life with opportunities that I know are not of my hand or any other human hand. He has shown me that it's a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates. In the words of the late Charlie Laughton*, who said, ""When you've got God, you've got a friend. And that friend is you.""To my family, that's who and what I look forward to. To my father, who I know is up there right now with a big pot of gumbo. He's got a lemon meringue pie over there. He's probably in his underwear and he's got a cold can of Miller Lite. And he's dancin' right now. To you, Dad, you taught me what it means to be a man. To my mother who's here tonight, who taught me and my two older brothers Ð demanded Ð that we respect ourselves, and what we in turn learned was then we were better able to respect others. Thank you for that, Mama. To my wife Camila and my kids, Levi, Vida and Mr. Stone, the courage and significance you give me every day I go out the door is unparalleled. You are the four people in my life that I want to make the most proud of me. Thank you.And to my hero; that's who I chase. Now, when I was 15 years old I had a very important person in my life come to me and say, ""Who's your hero?"" And I said, I don't know; I gotta think about that. Give me a couple of weeks. I come back two weeks later, this person comes up and says, ""Who's your hero?"" I said, I thought about it. You know who it is? I said, it's me in 10 years. So I turned 25; ten years later that same person comes to me and goes, ""So, are you a hero?"" And I was like, not even close! No, no, no. She said, ""Why?"" I said, because my hero's me at 35. So you see every day, every week, every month and every year of my life, my hero's always 10 years away. I'm never gonna be my hero. I'm not gonna attain that; I know I'm not. And that's just fine with me, because that keeps me with somebody to keep on chasin'.So to any of us, whatever those things are: whatever it is we look up to, whatever it is we look forward to, and whoever it is we're chasin'. To that I say: Amen. To that I say: Alright, alright, alright. To that I say: Just keep livin'.

Thank you so much. It's quite overwhelming. Thank you to the members of the Academy for this honor; my dear friends, who are here tonight; Gena and George, for your kind words. To my hero, Louis Zamperini. The cast of ""Blood and Honey."" And most of all to my family. My love, your support and your guidance make everything that I do possible. Madd Š—– I'm not going to cry, I promise. [Laughs] I won't embarrass you. You and your brothers and sisters are my happiness, and there's no greater honor in this world than being your mom. I'm very humbled to be here tonight among so many extraordinary artists. My mother loved art. She loved film. She supported any crazy thing I did, but whenever it had meaning she made a point of telling me that is what film is for. And she never had a career as an artist. She never had the opportunity to express herself beyond her theater class. But she wanted more than for herself, she wanted for Jamie and I to know what it is to have a life as artists, and she gave us that chance. She drove me to every audition and she would wait in the car for hours. Always make me feel really good all the times I didn't get the job, and when I did we would jump up and down and scream and yell like little girls. She wasn't really the best critic since she never had anything unkind to say, but she did give me love and confidence and, above all, she was very clear that nothing would mean anything if I didn't live a life of use to others.And I didn't know what that meant for a long time. I came into this business young and worried about my own experiences and my own pain, and it was only when I began to travel and look and live beyond my home, did I understand my responsibility to others. And when I met survivors of war and famine and rape, I learned what life is like for most people in this world and how fortunate I was to have food to eat, a roof over my head, a safe place to live, and the joy of having my family safe and healthy. And I realized how sheltered I had been and I was determined never to be that way again.We are all, everyone in this room, so fortunate. I have never understood why some people are lucky enough to be born with the chance that I had, to have this path in life, and why across the world there's a woman just like me, with the same abilities and the same desires, the same work ethic and love for her family, who would most likely make better films and better speeches, only she sits in a refugee camp and she has no voice. She worries about what her children will eat, how to keep them safe, and if they'll ever be allowed to return home. I don't know why this is my life and that's hers. I don't understand that. But I will do as my mother asked, and I will do the best I can with this life to be of use. And to stand here today means that I did as she asked, and if she were alive she'd be very proud. So thank you for that.",2013,Honorary Award,2013.25,http://aaspeechesdb.oscars.org/results.aspx?AC=NEXT_RECORD&XC=/results.aspx&BU=http%3A%2F%2Faaspeechesdb.oscars.org%2F&TN=aatrans&SN=AUTO8997&SE=1457&RN=1391&MR=0&TR=0&TX=1000&ES=0&CS=0&XP=&RF=WebReportList&EF=&DF=WebReportOscars&RL=0&EL=0&DL=0&NP=255&ID=&MF=oscarsmsg.ini&MQ=&TI=0&DT=&ST=0&IR=0&NR=314&NB=0&SV=0&SS=0&BG=&FG=&QS=&OEX=ISO-8859-1&OEH=utf-82013 (86th) Academy Awards,Honorary Award,No title.,"To Angela Lansbury, an entertainment icon who has created some of cinema's most memorable characters, inspiring generations of actors.","Emma Thompson, Geoffrey Rush, Robert Osborne","November 16, 2013; The Governors Awards (Ray Dolby Ballroom, Hollywood & Highland Center)","Oh, you have no idea. Oh my God. Oh, this is so marvelous. Thank you. Oh, this is amazing; what an incredible moment. Gosh. What an eleven o'clock number! Oh wow. You know, when I was first asked by the Academy who I would like to introduce me, I thought carefully and I came to a conclusion that the one person who really knew about my early work was Robert, Robert Osborne. I mean, so many of the legendary directors and producers who gave me such incredible opportunities in film, they were long gone, you know. I was still around. But thanks to Turner Classic Movies and Robert those great films are shown and studied and discussed by students everywhere, as well as seen by a huge general audience. So, thank you, TMC, and thank you, Robert, for keeping me alive all these years. [Laughs]Emma, bless your heart. ""Aunt Adelaide"" was a wonderful moment for me because I had sort of pulled out completely of everything when my darling husband Peter died. And you, by inviting me to play the dreaded ""Aunt Adelaide,"" you simply helped me get back on track. And I am incredibly indebted to you for that.You know, during the long course of my career in film and television and theater I have known and worked with the very best of their time. You know, Ingrid Bergman, that beautiful, lovely woman. Bette Davis, crazy, wonderful dame. Kate Hepburn, [makes a growling noise] you know...I give her credit, really, for getting me into the part...she really got me the part in ""State of the Union."" I don't think I ever would have got it without her help. And, you know, people like Orson Welles and Laurence Olivier and Frank Sinatra, Paul Newman and Spencer Tracy. James Earl Jones, who I just completed a six-month tour of ""Driving Miss Daisy"" in Australia with; which was a fantastic experience. And I must tell you, I even had coffee in the MGM commissary with Clark Gable. That's as far as it went, you understand. But we were on the lot together. I once saw him driving down Sunset Blvd., I'll never forget, in a dark brown Mercedes convertible. I never got over it. And when I could afford it I got the same car in dark brown [laughs] and drove it for years until it was stolen.But how would I have even begun my career in ""Gaslight"" without the belief of the great directors of that time, in that case, of course, George Cukor. Or Arthur [sic] Lewin in ""The Picture of Dorian Gray."" Or been given the incredible role of ""Mrs. Iselin"" in ""The Manchurian Candidate"" by the great John Frankenheimer, whose widow is here with me tonight, bless her heart. And I'm so proud that she is. I just couldn't top that role, so I took off for Broadway and musical comedy by way of Stephen Sondheim's ""Anyone Can Whistle"" and Jerry Herman's ""Mame.""Now, movies have taken a bit of a back seat since then, except of course for darling ""Mrs. Potts"" and ""Eglantine Price."" But in 1984, I came back to Universal City and I stayed around for twelve years playing ""Jessica Fletcher"" in ""Murder, She Wrote."" The interesting thing is that ""Murder, She Wrote"" has given me more worldwide attention than any role I ever played in movies or on the stage [laughs]. And it's a wonderful thing to be known, you know, in Spain and Portugal and Paris and France and Germany and everywhere, and, you know, to have a whole kind of worldwide career. That's what television does for you if have a hit show, and we did.You know, you can't imagine how happy and proud, indeed I feel really undeserving of this gorgeous golden chap. And I want to thank the Governors' Honorary Oscar from the Academy tonight, and to be here in the company of my beloved family and friends instead of sitting, shivering with hope and then disappointment in Grauman's Chinese Theatre in the 1940s and 60s Ð yeah. Sharing this wonderful occasion with me tonight are my twin brothers Edgar and Bruce Lansbury, who traveled with me and our mother Moyna to this great country as evacuees from England in 1940.

Thank you so much. Thank you very much. This is so nice, so nice of you. Ladies and gentlemen, it has been a longtime dream of mine that I would one day receive an Honorary Oscar, and tonight I feel I am one step closer to that dream. [Tom Hanks walks over to the podium to take a picture of himself with Martin.] Oh, cool. Hey! Thanks [laughs]. So now it's just, the class level has dropped completely. I can't possibly express how excited I am tonight, because the Botox is fresh. You know, it is said that the art and craft of filmmaking is collaborative, so to be singled out and rewarded tonight means that that is not true. [Looking around the room:] Is it my imagination or is this year's Oscar ceremony a little on the cheap side? I must thank the people who spoke on my behalf tonight. My high school friend Bill Taylor. Bill Ð by the way, he was a distinguished visual effects artist and cinematographer Ð whoever thought we would meet more than fifty years later on such an auspicious stage. Congratulations on your life and career too, Bill. And following Bill, a comedian so renowned and funny, whose work has only grown over the years and who never fails to make us laugh in new and unique ways; if only we had had someone like that tonight. You should have seen Marty Short's face fall when I told him the gift basket was taxable. And then the beautiful speech by Tom Hanks. Thank you, Tom. Everybody loves Tom Hanks. What a talent. Tom Hanks...Tom Hanks...I saw ""Captain Phillips."" I didn't think it was so funny.But seriously, I have so many people in my career to mention and thank. My very first manager back in the sixties, Bill McEuen. My first two agents, Marty Klein and John Gaines; some of you may remember them. John Gaines was all business. One time he called me and he said, ""Steve, two things. One: hello..."" Carl Reiner. How lucky was I to get with Carl Reiner, who taught me so much about how to work on a script. David Picker. Michael Gendler, my lawyer for over, I think it's thirty years is it, Michael? Something like that. I stick with people until they die. Nancy Meyers and Charles Shyer. Nora Ephron. Frank Griffin, my makeup man for over Ð how many? Twenty years? More than that, more than that. Dan Melnick, a producer who had a great eye for a script. Fred Schepisi, who directed ""Roxanne."" John Hughes, who wrote and directed ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles."" I read the first script and it was, the first script was 165 pages long. I loved the script. I said to John, ""What are you thinking about cutting?"" And he said, ""Cutting?"" The first cut of the film was 4_ hours long.Phil Robinson, who's here tonight, and wrote ""All of Me,"" which absolutely changed my career. Brian Grazer, another producer who kept his eye on the script. Ron Howard. David Mamet. Larry Kasdan, the great Larry Kasdan. Frank Oz, who's here tonight, who did so much great comedies, some of my best comedies with him. Mick Jackson, who directed ""L.A. Story."" John Landis, who directed the little movie that could, the ""ÁThree Amigos!."" Bob Simonds. Ed Limato, God rest his soul. Adam Venit. So many of my agents have died; watch out, Adam. My wife Anne Stringfield, who is as beautiful as she is smart. And...hey [begins to tear up]. I knew I wasn't going to make it through this speech. I read it to my dog this morning and wept. My wife alone would have been enough reward for my life but now she has brought me a wonderful child. And for some mysterious reason she really loves that child. I don't know; I don't get it.In 2008, Nancy Meyers asked me to appear in ""It's Complicated"" with Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin. And I hadn't done a movie in a long while and I didn't really know how I felt about them anymore. Because along with the joy that they had brought me over the past thirty-four years, people in this room know they also bring an equal amount of artistic heartache. And I went out to the set, across the Queensboro Bridge, on that cold winter morning. And on the first day of shooting I opened the door to the dark soundstage, and I stepped over all those black snaking electric cables, and walked past the craft service table that overflowed with boxes of raisins and bagels and muffins, and the slowest toaster in the world, and jars of M&M's and Twizzlers for breakfast, and every variety of mustard. And as I made this little journey that I had made a thousand times at every studio in this city, walking through the corridors, through this flimsy plywood flats, and the light changing from pitch black to blinding white, I thought: Home. So to get an award for something that you realize has seeped into your bones and to understand tonight that the work over the decades has at least meant something to someone is especially satisfying.But working in the movies has also brought something, an amazing gift, that has accummulated through these decades of filmmaking that cannot be matched, something wonderful and magical and its impact on my life is profound. Friends Ð fascinating, funny, and lifelong. Many of them are here in this room tonight.

And I'd like to thank Chris Rock for bringing humor into the moment. And I'd like to also thank all of you who are here this evening. My very good friends and very close friends, who have turned out to be in support. And all the rest of you whom I don't know intimately but have felt your presence in my life because I've seen your art, I've seen your work, I've seen your poetry; and I have been inspired by much. So thank you for all this, and I will now get on with my remarks for this evening. America has come a long way since Hollywood in 1915 gave the world the film ""Birth of a Nation."" By all measure, this cinematic work was considered the greatest film ever made. The power of moving pictures to impact on human behavior was never more powerfully evidenced than when after the release of this film American citizens went on a murderous rampage. Races were set one against the other. Fire and violence erupted. Baseball bats and billy clubs bashed heads. Blood flowed in streets of our cities and lives were lost. The film also gained the distinction of being the first film ever screened at the White House. The then-presiding president, Woodrow Wilson, openly praised the film. And with the power of this presidential anointing validated the film's brutality and its grossly distorted view of history. This, too, further inflamed the nation's racial divide.In 1935, at the age of eight, sitting in a Harlem theater, I watched in awe and wonder the incredible feats of the white superhero, Tarzan of the Apes. Tarzan was a sight to see. This porcelain Adonis, this white liberator, who could speak no language, swinging from tree to tree, saving Africa from the tragedy of destruction by a black indigenous population of inept, ignorant, void-of-any-skills population governed by ancient superstitions with no heart for Christian charity. Through this film the virus of racial inferiority, of never wanting to be identified with anything African, swept into the psyche of its youthful observers. And for the years that followed Hollywood brought abundant opportunity for black children in their Harlem theaters to cheer Tarzan and boo Africans. Native Americans, our Indian brothers and sisters, fared no better. And at the moment, Arabs ain't lookin' so good.But these encounters set other things in motion. It was an early stimulus to the beginning of my rebellion. Rebellion against injustice and human distortion and hate. How fortunate for me that the performing arts became the catalyst that fueled my desire for social change. In its pursuit I came upon fellow artists, like the great actor Ð and my hero Ð singer-humanist Paul Robeson, painter Charles White, dancer Katherine Dunham. Historian's superior academic mind, Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois. Social strategist and educator Eleanor Roosevelt. Writers Langston Hughes and Maya Angelou and James Baldwin. They all inspired me. They excited me. Deeply influenced me. And they were also my moral compass. It was Robeson who said, as you heard in the film earlier, ""Artists are the gatekeepers of truth. They are civilization's radical voice."" This Robeson-environment sounded like a desired place to be and given the opportunity to dwell there has never disappointed me.For my life of activism and a commitment to social change, the opposition has been fiercely punitive. Some who have controlled institutions of culture and commentary have at times used their power to not only distort truth but to punish the truthseekers. With interventions like McCarthyism and the blacklist, Hollywood too has sadly played its part in these tragic scenarios and on occasion I have been one of its targets. However, from the cultural environment that gave us all this social drama, all those movies Ð ""Birth of a Nation,"" Tarzan of the Apes, ""Song of the South,"" to name but a few Ð today's cultural harvest yields a sweeter fruit. ""Defiant Ones,"" ""Schinder's List,"" ""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""12 Years a Slave,"" and many more. And all of this happening at the dawning of technological creations that will give artists boundless regions of possibilities to give us deeper insights into human existence. How fortunate for me that I have lived long enough for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to have chosen to bestow this honor upon me.Tonight is no casual encounter for me. Along with the trophy of honor, there's another layer that gives this journey this kind of wonderful Hollywood ending. To be rewarded by my peers for my work in human rights, and civil rights, and for peace, well, let me put it this way. It powerfully mutes the enemy's thunder. Approaching 88 years of age, how truly poetic that as I joyfully glow with my fellow honorees we should have in our midst as one of our celebrators a man who did so much in his own life to redirect the ship of racial hatred in American culture. His efforts made the journey a bit easier. Ladies and gentlemen, I refer to my friend Ð my elderly friend Ð Sidney Poitier. [Poitier joins him onstage.]I thank the Academy and its Board of Governors for this honor, for this recognition. I really wish I could be around for the rest of this century to see what Hollywood does with the rest of the century. Maybe, just maybe, it could be civilization's game changer. After all, Paul Robeson said, ""Artists are the radical voice of civilization."" Each and every one of you in this room with your gifts, and your power, and your skills, could perhaps change the way in which our global humanity mistrusts itself. Perhaps we as artists and as visionaries for what's better in the human heart and the human soul, could you influence citizens everywhere in the world to see the better side of who and what we are as a species.I thank each and every one of you for this honor. And to my fellow honorees, I could have had no better company than to have shared this evening with each of you.

And thank you, Phil, for what you said and what you gave me. He has already said what I wanted to say first, that today it's my daughter's, Iris, birthday. Which is a strange coincidence. So allow me to say, Iris, bon anniversaire. And then, of course I'm very grateful to the members of the Academy for accepting me as a new member and this totally unexpected Oscar. I think at the moment here tonight, about some of the great directors I've been working with and who have already passed away. Like Luis Bu–uel, of course, Jacques Tati, Louis Malle, Patrice ChŽreau, Nagisa ïshima, Marco Ferreri, Jacques Deray. They all taught me something, each of them. And they're always present, even today, even now in this moment, when I'm working and when I hear, I believe I hear their voices in my ears. In a way, they are all here tonight with us. And of course I think also about the directors who are still alive, like that one [pointing to Philip Kaufman onstage], and like Volker Schlšndorff that you saw in the film. Like Milos Forman, of course. Like Peter Brook, who is going to turn 90 pretty soon and still very much alive and working. So that's all I want to say. We Ð a screenwriter is nothing without a director. And with such directors as the ones I've been happy to work with, it's a gift. It's just a series of gifts.Now I'd like also to say something about the fact that this Oscar goes to a screenwriter. And I'm very happy of this because very often the screenwriters are forgotten, are ignored. They are like shadows passing through [the] history of cinema. Their names do not appear in the reviews, very seldom, but still they are filmmakers. That's why tonight I like to share this priceless statue with all my colleagues Ð the ones I know, the ones I don't know Ð from all over the world to share with them.

And I think I've been lucky because I've been able to participate in the last era when we can make films with paper, pencil, and film. Another fact of luck is that my country has not been at war for the fifty years that I have been making films. Of course we've profited from wars, but we're very fortunate that we have not had to go to war ourselves. But my greatest luck is that I've been able to meet Miss Maureen O'Hara today. So I've been so happy and feel so blessed with luck in my life.

Thank you, both of you. And of course thank you to the Academy for this recognition. I'm so honored. I wouldn't be here tonight if it wasn't also for a few other gentlemen who I was lucky to work with along the way. Charles Laughton, who signed me to my first movie contract and is totally responsible for my career. The Duke, John Wayne... [edit]. And of course, that old devil himself, the great John Ford. Pappy, we finally got an Oscar. I'd also like to say thank you to all my fans who have been so kind to me over the years and truly made this night possible.I'm so proud to receive this award because it comes from my peers, who represent every element of the motion picture business. Believe me, the admiration is mutual. I am honored beyond words. Thank you with all my heart, and I'll leave you with this old Irish saying: May the road rise to meet you; the wind be always at your back; and may the sun shine warmly upon your face.
